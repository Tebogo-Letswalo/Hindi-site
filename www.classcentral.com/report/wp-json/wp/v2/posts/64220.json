There is a difference of which beginners may not be acutely aware.

Many of the courses considered, you\u2019ll notice, do indeed have a computer science portion. None of the courses, however, are strictly computer science courses, which is why something like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/mooc\/442\/edx-cs50x-introduction-to-computer-science\">Harvard\u2019s CS50x<\/a> on edX is excluded. Most entering the data field won\u2019t need detailed computation theory and topics like computer networking. This guide is focused on the practical skills that the vast majority of data scientists use.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"how-we-pick-courses\">How We Picked Courses to Consider<\/h2>\n<p>Each course must fit four criteria:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>It introduces programming and,\u00a0optionally, computer science<\/b>. See above.<\/li>\n<li><b>The language of instruction is Python or R.<\/b> These are by far the two most popular programming languages used in data science.<\/li>\n<li><b>It must be an interactive online course, so no books or text-based tutorials.<\/b> Regarding the latter, Codecademy\u2019s video-less and text editor-based courses would qualify, but strict text tutorials like the ones from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.r-tutor.com\/r-introduction\">R tutorial<\/a> would not. Though books are viable ways to learn programming, Python, and R, this guide focuses on courses.<\/li>\n<li><b>It must be a decent length: at least ten hours in total for estimated completion.<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/python_r.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64229\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/python_r.jpg\" alt=\"python_r\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/python_r.jpg 1087w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/python_r-300x83.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/python_r-768x212.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/python_r-1024x283.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1087px) 100vw, 1087px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>We believe we covered every notable course that exists and which\u00a0fits the above criteria. Since there are seemingly hundreds of courses on Udemy in Python and R, we chose to consider the most reviewed and highest rated ones only. There is a chance we missed something, however. Please let us know if you think that is the case.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"how-we-tested\">How We Tested<\/h2>\n<p>We compiled average rating and number of reviews from Class Central and other review sites to calculate a weighted average rating for each course. If a series had multiple courses, like Rice University\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/mooc\/408\/coursera-an-introduction-to-interactive-programming-in-python-part-1\">Part 1<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/mooc\/3196\/coursera-an-introduction-to-interactive-programming-in-python-part-2\">Part 2<\/a>, the weighted average rating across all courses was calculated. We also read text reviews and used this feedback to supplement the numerical ratings.<\/p>\n<p>A subjective syllabus judgment was made\u00a0\u2014 see the \u201cwhy you should trust us\u201d section. We were looking for three main characteristics:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Coverage of the fundamentals of programming.<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>Coverage of more advanced, but useful, topics in programming. <\/b>(E.g.\u00a0several courses choose to not cover object-oriented programming.

This course is more gentle, however, with reviewers noting that it might not prepare you as well as other options. Dr. Chuck himself noted that this course is a bridge to more advanced programming courses: \u201c<em>I would suggest that after students complete my Python course, if they are interested in more programming, that they would take the Rice course.<\/em>\u201d We also felt that the reviews for our #1 pick were more enthusiastic.
