The company registered lackluster growth, forcing it to take drastic measures. Vishal Makhijani <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-ceo-vishal-makhijani-steps-down\/\">stepped down<\/a> as CEO and Sebastian Thrun, Udacity founder, stepped in. The company closed or downscaled several of its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-layoffs-125-employees\/\">offices<\/a> around the world. Some of its Nanodegrees, such as those dedicated to virtual reality, aren&#8217;t accepting enrollments anymore. And in three rounds of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-lays-off-20-of-staff-continues-transformation\/\">layoffs<\/a>, Udacity parted with over 40% of its employees.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A bit of late announcement; <\/p>\n<p>I left my job at Udacity a few weeks ago. I absolutely enjoyed working with wonderful people such as <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MatDrinksTea?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MatDrinksTea<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/luis_likes_math?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@luis_likes_math<\/a>.   <br \/>Despite my great time at Udacity, most of the people I was excited to work with, also left the company.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Parnian (@parnianbarekat) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/parnianbarekat\/status\/1123718191883145217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 1, 2019<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>Alluding to the need for restructuring, Thrun simply <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/under-thrun-udacity-revamps-its-strategy\/\">explained<\/a>: \u201cour trajectory was not long-term tenable.\u201d He later <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-lays-off-20-of-staff-continues-transformation\/\">added<\/a> that through these initiatives, he was confident Udacity could \u201ccontinue to grow [&#8230;] while achieving a break-even position.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Increased Prices<\/h2>\n<p>Amid the two other, seemingly positive announcements, Udacity revealed an important change to its Nanodegree pricing.<\/p>\n<p>Since the company completed its switch to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-nanodegrees-term-based-scheduling\/\">term-based scheduling<\/a> in June 2018, as originally reported by Class Central, Nanodegrees have had a fixed price (between $600 and $2,400) that gave learners access to the Nanodegree content for a predetermined amount of time (between 3 and 8 months).<\/p>\n<p>Going forward, all Nanodegrees will cost $399 per month, with estimated completion times ranging from 3 to 6 months. According to Udacity, these time estimates are <a href=\"https:\/\/udacity.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360027788171-Is-it-possible-to-complete-a-Nanodegree-program-in-1-month-I-want-to-know-if-I-can-realistically-pay-just-one-month-and-complete-the-program-\">data-driven<\/a>: \u201cThe suggestions are based on data we collect on what is a realistic time frame to fully get the most out of our Nanodegree programs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, in light of Udacity&#8217;s own time estimates, students can expect to pay between $1,200 and $2,400 for their Nanodegree. So although the cost of the longer, more expensive Nanodegrees remains the same, the cost of the shorter, more affordable ones \u2014 that is, the vast majority of Udacity\u2019s catalog \u2014 has effectively doubled.<\/p>\n<p>Udacity argues that its new pricing scheme is more flexible. And all Nanodegrees now include the extended Mentor and Career support. But whether students will be willing to pay a premium for these features remains to be seen \u2014 particularly considering that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Last year, Udacity already <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-nanodegrees-price-increase\/\">increased Nanodegree prices<\/a> by as much as 300% \u2014 these used to cost $200 per month at launch.<\/li>\n<li>Two years ago, Udacity <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-nanodegree-upfront-payment\/\">stopped promising<\/a> Nanodegree graduates a job and 50% of their tuition back if they graduated in less than a year.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Revamped Mentorships<\/h2>\n<p>For the better part of the past year, Udacity has been using a community-centered approach to learner support: Nanodegree students would ask questions on the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.udacity.com\/2018\/10\/introducing-student-hub.html\">Student Hub<\/a> \u2014 a Slack-like communication tool built into the Udacity platform \u2014 and receive help from Mentors and students alike. This form of support will continue to be available.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/2a_project-chat@2x.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-68890\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/2a_project-chat@2x-1024x632.png\" alt=\"Udacity Student Hub\" width=\"1024\" height=\"632\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/2a_project-chat@2x-1024x632.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/2a_project-chat@2x-300x185.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/2a_project-chat@2x-768x474.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>But moving forward, each Nanodegree student will also be paired with a dedicated Mentor who will offer one-on-one support via chat or video calls, and present webinars on technical subjects. Besides answering questions, Mentors will provide students with a sense of accountability by helping them set weekly learning goals.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Nanodegree students will receive support from Career Coaches. According to Udacity, half of their students are job seekers. Career Coaches will assist them through their job search, notably by offering personalized resume feedback and interview advice.<\/p>\n<p>In a sense, Udacity is reverting back to its old ways: up until mid-2018, they used to match students with dedicated Mentors in some Nanodegrees. However, their new approach strengthens the bond between Mentors and Mentees with a view to building a community that isn\u2019t just large, but also cohesive. The approach reminds us of other e-learning companies, such as Springboard, which also includes one-on-one technical and career assistance for an end-to-end support experience.<\/p>\n<p>Through this new mentorship model, Udacity hopes to raise Nanodegree graduation rates from 34% to 60%.<\/p>\n<h2>New Scholarships<\/h2>\n<p>Udacity announced the launch of two new scholarship programs. These involve a two-step selection process. Students that make it to the end will get the chance to complete a Nanodegree in an AI-related subject, free of cost.<\/p>\n<p>The first scholarship is offered by Facebook and is a continuation of last year\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.udacity.com\/2018\/10\/introducing-the-pytorch-scholarship-challenge-from-facebook.html\">PyTorch Scholarship<\/a>.
