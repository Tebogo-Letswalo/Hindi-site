Even though the terms e-marketing and digital marketing are still a trend, social media marketing is gaining popularity among researchers and practitioners.<\/p>\n<p>The professional applying those frameworks and creating campaigns can be a small business owner, a marketer, a freelancer, or independent professionals looking for a way to build their online presence and find the right positioning for their business.<\/p>\n<p>The steps to make a successful social media marketing campaign starts by determining your niche and target audience to select the appropriate platform you will advertise. Then, you can get familiar with that media by taking a course and learning the specifics. To achieve even better results, you will need to learn the fundamentals of marketing, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/best-copywriting-courses\/\">copywriting<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/best-copywriting-courses\/\">creative writing<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/best-content-marketing-courses\/\">content writing<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/best-seo-courses\/\">SEO optimization<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To conclude, social media marketing is a set of tools and techniques that can be learned, practiced, and developed with the help of courses, software, and other professionals. This is indeed a valuable asset for any business and professionals. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oberlo.com\/statistics\/how-many-people-use-social-media\">Oberlo<\/a>, more than half of the world population use social media with a 9.9% increase per year. Eastern Asia has more than 1 billion people using social media and North America has over 300 million people connected.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Course Ranking Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous rankings. It involves a three-step process:<\/p>\n<p><b>First<\/b>,\u00a0 I\u2019m part of Class Central, the leading search engine for online courses. We have a database of more than 50K online courses and hundreds of thousands of crowdsourced reviews. So it seemed like the natural starting point.<\/p>\n<p>I started by leveraging the database to make a preliminary selection of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/subject\/social-media-marketing\">Social Media Marketing courses<\/a>, looking at things like ratings, reviews, and course bookmarks. So this was a purely data-driven step, relying on hard metrics to create an initial ranking that we could then iterate upon and expand.<\/p>\n<p>Using this approach, some of the top picks rapidly became apparent, since the best courses tend to have rave reviews. But I didn\u2019t stop there. Ratings and reviews rarely tell the whole story. So the next step was to bring my personal knowledge of online education into the mix.<\/p>\n<p><b>Second<\/b>, I used my experience as an online learner to evaluate each of the preliminary picks.<\/p>\n<p>I took part in a couple of in-person digital marketing bootcamps back in 2018 and 2019. Since then, there\u2019s been a big shift in the market. New player, TikTok, has changed the way most of us used to do business on such platforms; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/6\/30\/22557942\/instagram-no-longer-photo-app-video-entertainment-focus\">Instagram is now a video sharing platform<\/a>. I\u2019ve been following the current trends and can confidently say that the courses in the list will help you deliver great results, even though they cost a fraction of a traditional workshop.<\/p>\n<p><b>Third<\/b>, during my research, I came across courses that felt well-made but weren\u2019t well-known. If I adopted a purely data-centric approach, I would have to leave those courses out of the ranking, if only because they had fewer enrollments.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, I favored a holistic approach. I\u2019ve included more personal picks that hopefully surprise those of you who have already seen or taken the more popular social media marketing courses and are looking for something a bit different. You can also clearly see courses aimed at specific expertise as in YouTube guides and build your personal branding.<\/p>\n<p>After going through this process \u2014 combining Class Central data, my experience as a lifelong learner, and a lot of editing \u2014 we arrived at our final ranking. So far, I\u2019ve spent more than 20 hours building this ranking, and I intend to continue updating it in the future.<\/p>\n<p>As I mentioned before, social media marketing can be used by anyone. I tried to keep this list as diverse as possible with content for novice marketers, 100% inexperienced beginners, small business owners, and other professionals interested in learning a new skill.<\/p>\n<h2>Course Ranking Statistics<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some aggregate stats about the ranking:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Together, they account for 564,449 enrollments plus thousands of YouTube views.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The single most popular course in the ranking has nearly 200k enrollments.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">7 courses are free or free-to-audit, five courses are paid.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Without further ado, let\u2019s go through the top picks.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-1\">1. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/social-media-marketing-introduction-21550\">Introduction to Social Media Marketing (Meta)<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79339 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Introduction-to-Social-Media-Marketing-Meta.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Introduction-to-Social-Media-Marketing-Meta.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Introduction-to-Social-Media-Marketing-Meta-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Introduction-to-Social-Media-Marketing-Meta-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This course lays the foundation of social media marketing strategy.

This course is for creating a personal brand. It\u2019s a short course aimed for influencers, content creators, and small business owners who want to connect in a more personal way with their audience. In the end, that\u2019s what most users are looking for on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, to connect with real people. So, in that way, you can become the spokesperson of your brand.<\/p>\n<div class=\"quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text\">\n<p>\u201cThis class was way better than I anticipated. Usually when people speak about personal branding it tends to lean more into introspection and not as much into how you can engage the community around you. And I really valued the thoughts around meaningful content. This was a very well balanced class! \u201c &#8211; Carson Irvine (learner)<span class=\"quote_deco absolute top left height-100\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>In this 65-minute class, Kate Arends explores the evolution of her blog to explain why an authentic personal brand is important \u2014 and how to optimize yours for what you want, who you are, and what success means to you. Each short lesson is filled with data and experience as well as specific strategies and examples. A special focus on social media keeps everything tactical.<\/p>\n<p>Some topics covered are: Defining your content, Creating engaging content, Defining your channels, Channel worksheet, and more.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The class includes exclusive downloadable worksheets to help you put every lesson into action. These useful PDFs will help you identify what sets you apart, how to be strategic about what you share, and how to set goals for your work. They&#8217;re designed to use and reuse, giving you tools to rely on again and again.<\/p>\n<p>By the end of this course, you can submit your own project to receive feedback from your peers.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Skillshare<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor(s)<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Kate Arends<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>1-2 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td>39,331<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td>100% recommend (1,162 ratings)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Available<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The instructor, Kate Arends, is the founder of the lifestyle website <a href=\"http:\/\/witanddelight.com\/\">Wit &amp; Delight<\/a>, that has evolved into a brand celebrating a combination of veracious expression and simple elegance with an approachable, yet edited point of view.
