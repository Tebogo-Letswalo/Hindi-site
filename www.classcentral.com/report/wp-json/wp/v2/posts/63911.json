The institutions also need to provide any resources that students need in order to take SWAYAM courses, like computers or lab space, to those\u00a0students for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To earn these credits, students will need to do all the required assignments\/homework for these courses and then attend a final proctored exam. The exam will be held either in the local institute where the student is enrolled, in a nearby institute, or in a proctored center.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cost for each exam will be \u20b91000 ($15).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On successful completion of the course, the institution that taught the MOOC will\u00a0issue a certificate, along with the number of credits and grades. The student can then get credits transferred into his marks certificate (transcript) issued by the institution that he\/she is enrolled in.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the most worrisome part about SWAYAM. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SWAYAM was originally supposed to be built using Open edX, but now it seems it will be built by a team at Microsoft.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier in June, Microsoft was <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/tech\/tech-news\/Microsoft-to-design-app-for-governments-open-online-courses\/articleshow\/52789906.cms\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">selected<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a technical partner for SWAYAM. The deal is worth Rs 38 crore (~$6 million) and Microsoft will deploy a team of dedicated people to develop and maintain SWAYAM.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When The Indian Express asked R. Subrahmanyam, Additional Secretary for Technical Education at the Ministry of Human Resource Development,\u00a0about the choice of Microsoft over Open edX, he replied that \u201cAll that appears \u2018free\u2019 is not always free!\u201d You can read more about the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/business\/business-others\/moocs-platform-not-all-is-open-or-swayam-about-it-2948802\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">entire saga here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a fully-fledged MOOC platform is a major undertaking that other providers have already been doing for years. By not re-purposing a platform that already exists and which is used by a global community (e.g. Open edX), the SWAYAM team will have to start right from scratch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They will have to learn everything that the MOOC provider community has already learned. This might cause quite a few hiccups in the first few iterations of SWAYAM.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of writing this post, I was not able to find out which domain SWAYAM will be hosted on.
