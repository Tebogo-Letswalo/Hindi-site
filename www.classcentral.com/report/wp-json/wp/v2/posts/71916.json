Bootcamps, which are typically defined as short term technology training programs, have existed since at least 2012.

But bootcamps have at times played an outsized role in how policy makers view education. For example, the Income Share Agreements (ISAs) that bootcamps helped popularize have attracted interest from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/news\/2019\/12\/16\/experiment-would-allow-federal-loans-be-repaid-through-income-share-agreements\">Trump administration<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In this edition of MOOCWatch, Class Central will get you up to speed on the bootcamp industry, covering high profile bootcamps like Lambda School, as well as some of the other bootcamps that slipped under the radar.<\/p>\n<h3>Research, Reports and Data<\/h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/bootcamps-and-isas\/\">Bootcamps and ISAs: Economics, Challenges, and Opportunities<\/a><\/strong> <em>via Class Central<\/em><br \/>\nClass Central\u2019s comprehensive report on bootcamps and ISAs, documenting the structural issues bootcamps encounter when scaling.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rti.org\/rti-press-publication\/alternative-and-independent\"><strong>Alternative and independent: the universe of technology-related \u201cbootcamps\u201d<\/strong><\/a> via <em>RTI<\/em><br \/>\nRTI\u2019s comprehensive survey of the bootcamp industry, categorising different bootcamp programs and documenting their average length and cost.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/coding-bootcamps-outcomes-data\/\">How to Choose a Coding Bootcamp Using Outcomes Data<\/a><\/strong> via <em>Class Central<\/em><br \/>\nA compilation of the graduation and placement rate data of major bootcamps.
