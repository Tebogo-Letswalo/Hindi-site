That machine learning course was one of the first massive open online courses (MOOCs) to ever be released for free on the Internet, pioneering the way for other courses to do the same. By the end of its lifetime, over 4.8 million students had taken the course, hence earning its place as one of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/top-moocs-2021-edition\/\">Class Central\u2019s most popular courses of all time<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Andrew Ng, the instructor, was greatly inspired by the success of his course. He and another Stanford processor <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Daphne_Koller\">Daphne Koller<\/a> went on to co-found Coursera which has arguably become one of the most successful course providers to date. He also has a wealth of experience behind him, having directed groundbreaking AI research projects like <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Google_Brain\">Google Brain<\/a> which created TensorFlow, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Baidu\">Baidu<\/a> where he worked on big data and AI, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.deeplearning.ai\/about\/\">DeepLearning.AI<\/a> which creates courses on artificial intelligence like the very one you\u2019re looking at right now, and finally Landing.AI which provides AI-powered SaaS products.<\/p>\n<p>So having heard the legacy of the course and the man behind the course, let\u2019s get into the contents!<\/p>\n<h2>Overview of the Syllabus<\/h2>\n<p>The aim of this course is three-fold, with each week focusing on one aspect of the course.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Build a deep reinforcement learning model.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the first week, you\u2019ll begin with an overview of unsupervised learning. Whereas supervised learning involves labeled data, unsupervised learning does not. You\u2019ll learn how to apply clustering algorithms like the k-means algorithm, which groups similar pieces of data into the same \u2018bucket\u2019, and anomaly detection, which detects data that don\u2019t fit the trend. You\u2019ll also find that clustering has many important practical applications, such as market segmentation to help businesses identify groups of consumers to market to, as well as anomaly detection to help banks identify potentially fraudulent transactions.<\/p>\n<p>Recommender systems is one of the most commercially important machine learning technologies; just think of the many times you\u2019ve been recommended relevant items while shopping online or scrolling through social media. The second week breaks down the technology behind recommender systems. In Tensorflow, you\u2019ll implement collaborative and content based filtering recommender systems. But more importantly, you\u2019ll also discuss the ethical implications to consider when deploying recommender systems.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_84035\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84035\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-84035\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Unsupervised-Learning-Recommenders-Reinforcement-Learning-Week-2-Making-recommendations.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Unsupervised-Learning-Recommenders-Reinforcement-Learning-Week-2-Making-recommendations.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Unsupervised-Learning-Recommenders-Reinforcement-Learning-Week-2-Making-recommendations-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Unsupervised-Learning-Recommenders-Reinforcement-Learning-Week-2-Making-recommendations-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-84035\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From week 2, &#8220;Making recommendations&#8221;<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The final week of the course switches gears by discussing reinforcement learning.

That is the work of reinforcement learning, where agents are placed in an interactive environment and are rewarded for desired behaviors while being punished for undesired behavior, that is,\u00a0 learning from trial and error. The final week will teach you about reinforcement learning to the point where you\u2019ll build a deep Q-learning neural network that can land a virtual lunar lander on Mars!<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_84036\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84036\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-84036\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Unsupervised-Learning-Recommenders-Reinforcement-Learning-Week-3-What-is-Reinforcement-Learning_.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Unsupervised-Learning-Recommenders-Reinforcement-Learning-Week-3-What-is-Reinforcement-Learning_.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Unsupervised-Learning-Recommenders-Reinforcement-Learning-Week-3-What-is-Reinforcement-Learning_-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Unsupervised-Learning-Recommenders-Reinforcement-Learning-Week-3-What-is-Reinforcement-Learning_-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-84036\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From week 3, &#8220;What is Reinforcement Learning?&#8221;<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Course Pedagogy<\/h2>\n<p>This course, like the other courses in the specialization, is taught especially well thanks to Andrew Ng\u2019s ability to turn the abstract into something that you can wrap your head around. By giving real-world examples of neural networks in action and motivations behind the math of some algorithms, he is able to condense large amounts of theory into small manageable chunks. In addition, there are also the occasional in-video questions that quiz you on what you\u2019ve just watched to make sure that you\u2019re paying attention.<\/p>\n<p>Each week in the course comes with quizzes that help you prepare for the best part of the course\u2009\u2014\u2009the labs. Through practice labs, you\u2019ll gain practical experience coding neural networks and machine learning systems while also applying valuable advice from the course.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if you need help with any of the course\u2019s exercises or are perplexed by some of the course\u2019s material, you\u2019ll find that the course\u2019s Discourse community is full of passionate and helpful individuals who\u2019ll do their best to help you out.<\/p>\n<h2>So should you take this course?<\/h2>\n<p>This course is great for those who either have taken the previous course in this series or already have some knowledge of Tensorflow programming \/ machine learning in general but want to further their skills or refresh their memory. Do note that the course is a little math heavy, so you might want to brush up on your linear algebra and calculus to keep up with some of the more advanced material.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, anyone auditing the course will not have access to the practice quizzes or labs, so those students are advised to take detailed notes from the lectures and try to implement the course materials by themselves or find other exercises to supplement their learning.<\/p>\n<p>I have individually reviewed all the courses in this specialization, and I\u2019ll soon give my verdict on the specialization itself.
