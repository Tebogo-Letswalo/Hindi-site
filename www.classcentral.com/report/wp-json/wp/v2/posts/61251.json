Courses offered by prestigious ivory towers (such as <a href=\"https:\/\/edx.org\" target=\"_blank\">edX<\/a> offerings from Harvard, MIT, Berkeley), intro to advanced college courses (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.coursera.org\" target=\"_blank\">Coursera<\/a>) job skills \u00a0(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.udacity.com\" target=\"_blank\">Udacity<\/a>) are available to all with internet access. \u00a0An elementary school student can pursue astrophysics, an armchair psychologist can enjoy lectures on Jungian psychology, we all can broaden our minds with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\" target=\"_blank\">TED talks <\/a>(hat tip, Beyonc\u00e9!), and grandparents can sharpen math skills in preparation for homework helping via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\" target=\"_blank\">Khan Academy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>From a practical lens, the convenience factor in and of itself is huge. A Slate article from early 2014 pointed out that fully 80% of those currently engaged in obtaining an undergraduate degree are not the residing-on-campus, aged 18-22 crowd. \u00a0This 80% represents folks returning to or starting school outside of that 18-22 age range often simultaneously while balancing work and family life. \u00a0Digital education removes the geographical limiter, blessedly so, and education, for many in that 80% consumer pool, becomes an option where previously it was not. \u00a0At Georgia Tech\u2019s computer science master\u2019s program, for example, <em>\u201cThe average student in the online program is 34 years old; the average residential student, 23.\u201d <\/em>Digital education more broadly, has a measured universal appeal, and unlike the on-campus experience, is not limited to a specific age range.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-left cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Digital education&#8230;is not limited to a specific age range<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In a quickly forthcoming environment of drones, robotics and androids, humans delve deeper into an ability-based, idea and knowledge economy, a new environment in which Arianna Huffington believes, <em>\u201cCreativity matters above all else.\u201d<\/em> Mobile learning coupled with digital libraries will be needed for cultivating the behaviors, thought, ability and creativity necessary for human participation in this type of economy and culture. \u00a0And at last, with a technological backbone, we can all participate. \u00a0As beloved Dumbledore said,<i> \u201cIt matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.\u201d<\/i> \u00a0With the grace of digital education we can now add that it matters neither <b>where<\/b> someone is born.\u00a0 Plows, fields, and two-room cottages suddenly become less of an influence.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the edX folks are taking another giant-step-for-mankind in that direction.\u00a0 EdX is working with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of Labor to provide edX course \u201caimed at rural communities, women, youth and persons with disabilities.\u201d \u00a0Admittedly, open access to education in an environment that has a reported 58% internet access rate, combined with tightly prescribed gender expectations, may not be a magic pill, but it would seem an important step.

Maybe a master box containing these great lectures, available for institutional subscription? Will students be able to hop from MOOC to MOOC with background software accurately assessing mastery and when mastery of a specific set of courses is achieved, be awarded a (nameless? de-institutionalized?) degree? \u00a0This all sounds like a wonder of unlimited, high-quality education, delivered when needed\/wanted and brought to us via screens, games, videos, and virtual reality exercises.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Could that be our classroom of the future: piano lessons with Bach, physics by Leo Szilard, and ballet taught by Baryshnikiv<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The data analysis possible as a result of this new, student-centered digital model has rather electrifying potential. \u00a0If <a href=\"http:\/\/janemcgonigal.com\/\">Jane McGonigal<\/a> is right, and we can game our way into becoming better beings, from sticking to health goals, mastering personal finances, and lifting our sense of well-being, how about linking this high-quality educational gaming with algorithmic predictors tailored to the individual\u2019s educational performance? The GRE\u2019s algorithms selects questions based on the respondents prior answers, SNHU\u2019s course management software uses an algorithm to predict when a student would benefit from additional professor contact and when a student is likely to fail. David Evans, a University of Virginia computer science professor and early Udacity instructor, suggests data-analysis is inherently valuable to potential employers. \u00a0Clearly. What tech firm wouldn\u2019t want to talk to the top 5 performers from a computer science class of 200,000?<\/p>\n<p>From a microscopic lens, what could this data mean to the individual? \u00a0Perhaps a more accurate career match, based on displayed ability combined with self-selected courses of interest? \u00a0If Amazon\u2019s algorithm can cleverly predict I will enjoy <i>The Duchess of Duke Street<\/i> and <i>6-week 6-Pack<\/i>, and I Heart Radio knows I will enjoy Pavarotti\u2019s belting of Ava Maria and later, a little Aguilera, what would a career-path algorithm predict based on my academic performance and course selection? Along the way would it have suggested appropriate courses and training models (at what point would it have told me to ditch the violin)? I have a feeling the predictor algorithm would do a better job than I would, and likely saved years of sweaty anxiety (I have to pick a major?!?), inappropriate classes (geology?), and time\/effort spent with little discernible yield (rhythmic dictation).<\/p>\n<p>Would this result in greater success and happiness during the educational process and in the workforce? \u00a0According to recent Gallup research (2013) only 13% of workers are engaged while at work, worldwide&#8211;&#8216;engaged&#8217; being defined as \u201cpsychologically committed to their jobs and likely to be making positive contributions to their organizations.\u201d Could right-sized to the individual, machine-learning based algorithmic coursework suggestions increase engagement, leading to a happier, more productive workforce and more meaningful experience for working humans?<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-left cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Could&#8230;algorithmic coursework suggestions increase engagement?<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Delightfully, research on neuroplasticity suggests humans can be taught to build their brains. \u00a0As we are learning personalized AP calculus, could the digital educational environment be built to include educational activities that will strengthen our well-being, our pro-social behavior all while scaling-up our grey matter? \u00a0If it is true (as apparently it is) that \u201cwe can fundamentally improve our cognitive and emotional capacities\u201d can we then teach our way not only into understanding subjects but into becoming better beings?

At the moment, digital education has modeled itself on the classroom of the past. Lectures, quizzes, assessments, often some sort of discussion space all parsed out over a course term. Perhaps this isn\u2019t the ideal model of learning and training. Early cell phones, with their bread loaf-sized heft, were focused on meeting the mission of the land-line: making a phone call. Thirty years later, the phone has evolved into a mobile device surpassing early home computers. While I use my phone consistently (too much!) throughout every day, the feature I use the least? \u00a0The making-a-phone-call feature. What could digital education look like in 25 years? \u00a0A 2014 OCLC white paper believes that <em>\u201cWe are tipping toward an educational era of choice over tradition, convenience over perfection, self-service over predefined options.\u201d<\/em> The foundation blocks for new approaches are only now being set into place, and the innovation just begun.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-left cc-blockquote-text\"><p>It is important to remember that digital education is just beginning<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>While digital education looks and feels a bit different than chalk and slate, unchanged is the mission of education; knowledge, skill sets, preparation for employment and the world, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to flourish. As part of the educational process, one will likely gain utility skills: grammar, welding, an understanding of Socratic philosophy, depending upon the individual, their chosen program and institution. Simultaneously woven throughout the educational environment is the nurturing of the ability to achieve, to have potential, to flourish, which is indeed the more important higher-order aim of education. Technology can partner with great teachers to support, suggest, craft and escort the individual throughout a lifetime of education, indefatigably and incandescently upping our potential to flourish.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>References<\/h2>\n<p>Alden, Doug. &#8220;SNHU Offers 4-year Degree for $10,000.&#8221; <i>Union Leader<\/i>, May 6, 2014, 1. http:\/\/infoweb.newsbank.com\/.<\/p>\n<p>Crabtree, Steve. &#8220;Worldwide, 13% of Employees Are Engaged at Work.&#8221; Gallup Poll.
