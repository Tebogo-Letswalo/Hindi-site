When it was released, many scientific and engineering calculations were still being performed by hand, which was both time-consuming and error-prone. Although computers were capable of scientific computing, the languages used to program them were too low-level and difficult-to-learn for the average researcher.<\/p>\n<p>Fortran was the solution to the problem. It provided a more efficient and reliable way of performing scientific and engineering calculations while at the same time abstracting away the low-level concepts into higher-level ones, and hence became the first ever high-level programming language. It quickly dominated the scientific computing sphere as researchers could easily translate mathematical formulas into code and quickly perform complex simulations on large amounts of data within the matter of hours or even minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Over the decades, Fortran has undergone several major versions to keep up with current programming trends, with the most popular versions of Fortran being Fortran 77, 90, 95, 2003, 2008, <a href=\"https:\/\/fortranwiki.org\/fortran\/show\/Fortran+2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">and more recently, 2018<\/a>. The language continues to evolve and be refined to meet the changing needs of the latest ground-breaking scientific and engineering research.<\/p>\n<p>Hence despite its age, Fortran remains a popular language for HPC (high performance computing) and is in use in many areas such as weather modeling, materials science, molecular dynamics, and computational physics. Many national laboratories, universities, research institutes, aerospace and defense companies, and government agencies all rely on Fortran for their scientific work, and additionally Fortran is also seeing a resurgence <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/fortran-lang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in open-source activity<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Learning Fortran can be a valuable skill for anyone interested in scientific and engineering research, opening up a wide range of career opportunities and allowing individuals to contribute to the advancement of scientific and engineering knowledge.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png\" alt=\"Find your next course on Class Central\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Best Courses Guides Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous Best Courses Guides (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find them all here<\/a>).

With just these basic features, you can already begin writing useful scientific code.<\/p>\n<p>Adding on to what you\u2019ve learned, you\u2019ll deal with reading files containing large datasets, transforming the data, and extracting the results into another file. You\u2019ll also learn to differentiate between Fortran\u2019s built-in and derived data types, as well as labeling procedures to help communicate its effects to potential readers.<\/p>\n<p>Parallel programming is at the heart of high-performance computing. It can speed up code by a hundred-fold or even more. You\u2019ll see how to run code on multiple cores simultaneously, before moving on to other language features like interoperability with other languages (like C). Finally, you\u2019ll learn what the fuss is with object-oriented programming and follow the best practices for coding in Fortran.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course consists of 7 lectures.
