It is writing instructions for a computer to execute in order to accomplish a specific task. The simplest of things must be spelled out for the computer. Thanks to some clever mathematics and engineering, humans were able to make chips of sand understand the laws of logic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, computers only understand the language of 0s and 1s, so us humans must communicate with them in a different way. People have invented many different languages that allow us to talk to the computer to get a result. These human-readable languages can be converted into the 0s and 1s that computers understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But different programmers try to achieve different tasks with computers. Some programmers want the computer to build websites (web developers), while others want to create useful tools (software engineers) or develop fun interactive media (game developers).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since programming is so wide and diverse, there are many different industries and fields that one can specialize in, and some fields may pay more than others. Nonetheless, programmers are widely sought after as they keep the digital blood flowing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, software development employment is expected to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/ooh\/computer-and-information-technology\/software-developers.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rise by 22%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through 2030. And according to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/Salaries\/computer-programmer-salary-SRCH_KO0,19.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glassdoor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the national average salary for a programmer is $74,013 in the United States.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Course Ranking Methodology<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology I used in my previous rankings. It involves a three-step process:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>First<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, let me introduce myself. I\u2019m a content writer for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Class Central<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the leading search engine for online courses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@Elham\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@elham<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) built this ranking in collaboration with my friend and colleague<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@manoel\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@manoel<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To build this ranking, we scoured through Class Central\u2019s database of close to 100K online courses for the best courses by looking at things like ratings, reviews, and bookmarks. This data-driven process helped us come up with a bunch of the best courses out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good courses get noticed by word of mouth \u2014 and the very best tend to gather a lot of attention. That said, reviews don\u2019t always tell the whole story. In fact, some courses are so good at hugging the spotlight that other excellent resources can go unnoticed. So the next step was to bring our own knowledge of online education into the mix.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Second<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we used our experience as online learners to evaluate each preliminary pick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We both come from computer science backgrounds and are prolific online learners, having completed about 45 MOOCs between us. Additionally, Manoel has an<\/span>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/open-university-insiders-perspective\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online bachelor\u2019s in computer science<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while I am currently completing my foundation in computer science. So programming is a subject that we were both very familiar with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We analyzed and sifted through the courses, ranking them one by one. We bounced ideas off each other and made iterative improvements to the rankings, until we were both satisfied with the end result: the ranking you\u2019re reading right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Third<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, during our research, we came across courses that we felt were well-made but unfortunately weren\u2019t well-known. If we adopted a purely data-centric approach, we would have to leave those courses out of the ranking, if only because they had fewer enrollments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, we favored a holistic approach. To spice up this ranking, we\u2019ve added a wide range of courses\u2009of various programming languages to hopefully appeal to our reader\u2019s preference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After going through this process \u2014 combining Class Central data, our experience as lifelong learners, and a lot of editing \u2014 we arrived at our final ranking. So far, we\u2019ve spent more than 10 hours building this ranking, and we intend to continue updating it in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Course Ranking Statistics<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve presented some aggregate stats about the ranking:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, the course enrollment sums up to 4 million enrollments, with the largest course having close to 2.5 million enrollments.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every course in this ranking is free or free-to-audit.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The courses in this ranking account for a total of 38,338 reviews on Class Central.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the courses in this ranking are beginner friendly, except for <\/span><a href=\"#third\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Programming Languages, Part A<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coursera is the most popular provider in this ranking.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around 410k people are following <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/subject\/programming-and-software-development\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Programming Courses on Class Central<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s go through the top picks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"first\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/python-4319\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Programming for Everybody (University of Michigan)\u00a0<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_79260\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79260\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-79260 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner-12.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner-12.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner-12-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner-12-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-79260\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Charles Severance, aka Dr Chuck, the course instructor<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first course I\u2019d recommend to anyone new to programming would be <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/python-4319\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Programming for Everybody<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera. With close to 2.5 million enrollments on Coursera, this course is the most popular Python course out there and one of the most popular online courses ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course introduces you to the Python programming language. Python is easy to learn due to its elegant simplicity. It is the most-popular language according to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiobe.com\/tiobe-index\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the TIOBE index<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and is incredibly versatile\u2009\u2014\u2009capable of handling with ease tasks ranging from web development to machine learning.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is designed for complete beginners. It will teach you the foundations of programming which will transfer over to many other programming languages. All you need to know prior to taking this course is some basic arithmetic.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a computer? How does a computer run a program? Why is it easy for bugs to pop up in code? These are the questions the first part of the course seeks to answer. Do you know what the two fundamental skills of programming are? Knowing the programming language (duh!) and telling a story. Yes, programmers should be able to tell a descriptive story for the computer to follow and interpret. It\u2019s a funny way of putting it, but that\u2019s programming in a nutshell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, you\u2019ll install Python and choose a code editor (the course recommends <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/atom.io\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Atom<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). You\u2019re now ready to write your first line of code\u2009\u2014\u2009print(\u201cHello World!\u201d).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll start by studying the basic vocabulary and grammar of Python, to start constructing your own story. You\u2019ll learn about variables and expressions which store and compute values. You\u2019ll control the flow of your story by using conditionals like &#8216;if&#8217; and &#8216;else&#8217;, as well as repeat parts of your story with loops and iterations like &#8216;while&#8217; and &#8216;for&#8217;. Additionally, you\u2019ll know how to pass arguments to functions which allows you to reuse your code. Bye bye copy and paste!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of the course, you\u2019ll write a program that accepts input from the user, computes a result, and returns output back to the user. It may not seem like much, but it is a huge step toward becoming a programmer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course is 7 weeks long, with a total of 19 hours of learning material. It comes with a companion website where you\u2019ll code and submit your assignments (only if you have paid for the certificate). The book that the course is based on is freely available on the website.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of Michigan<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coursera<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charles Severance (aka Dr. Chuck)<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginner<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">28 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.5M<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.8 \/ 5.0 (205K)<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paid<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is the first of five in the specialization <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/python-18625\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Python for Everybody<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

As a programmer, you\u2019ll work with computers a lot, so having a basic understanding of these machines is essential! You\u2019ll then learn the jargon of computing and understand how code processing works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After setting up your programming environment, you\u2019ll be introduced to a couple of the basic principles of programming, like the difference between compiling and executing code and the write-run-debug cycle. You\u2019ll know how to analyze the results of running your code and use those results to revise it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, you\u2019ll be introduced to the paradigm of procedural programming in Python. You\u2019ll realize that a program is just sequences of lines of code that is executed to fulfill a purpose, and that programs can be chained to achieve more complex functionality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, you\u2019ll study what variables are and how to create them, the different data types (like integers, floats, and strings), as well as the reason we need variables in programming. You\u2019ll be introduced to mathematical, relational, and Boolean operators and understand how to use them to express complex logical relationships in code and even make \u201cdecisions\u201d such as running certain lines of code only if a predefined condition is met.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course consists of 5 weeks of material, with an expected 9\u201310 hours of work per week. The course comes with an online book. Each week is dedicated to a specific area of computer science and programming, so you may skip to areas you already know to make the best use of your time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two kinds of assessments you\u2019ll be able to complete if you audit the course for free: exercises and two practice tests. If you\u2019re a verified learner, you\u2019ll have access to chapter-level problem sets and complete a timed assessment at the end of the course.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">George Institute of Technology<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">edX<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Joyner<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginner<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">208K<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.8 \/ 5.0 (213)<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paid<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course is part of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/professional-certificate\/introduction-to-python-programming\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Introduction to Python Programming Professional Certificate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which closely matches Georgia Tech\u2019s undergraduate introduction to computer science, providing you with the skills needed to explore more advanced concepts and prepare for the professional world.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The professional certificate this course is part of earned Bronze Award for Computing &amp; IT at the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reimagine-education.com\/winners-2020-2019-2\/#1591154714692-81cd1471-5132\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 Reimagine Education awards<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course has 13.6K bookmarks and a whopping 4.8 stars out of 5.0 rating on Class Central, with several hundred reviews.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For all practical purposes, you&#8217;ll be completing the same course that students at undergrad Georgia Tech students take for credit.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-computing-in-python-i-fundamentals-and-procedural-programming-11469\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"third\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/programming-languages-452\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Programming Languages, Part A (University of Washington)<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_79256\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79256\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-79256 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner-4-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner-4-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner-4-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Banner-4-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-79256\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dan Grossman, the course instructor<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re looking to be a well-rounded programmer, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/programming-languages-452\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Programming Languages, Part A<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has your back. It\u2019s my third pick for the best programming course. Offered by the University of Washington on Coursera, this course introduces you to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a focus on functional programming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course is designed to teach students the core ideas around which every programming language is built upon. The point of the course is <\/span><b>not <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to teach you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Standard_ML\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SML<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Racket_(programming_language)\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Racket<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ruby_(programming_language)\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruby<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, it aims to show you the fundamental concepts that can be found and expressed in almost all programming languages, using these three different languages as an example. This allows you to think more deeply about the underlying ideas, and about how these ideas fit together instead of being distracted by surface-level syntax.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why functional programming? Well, functional programming encourages you to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is one of the most challenging MOOCs out there, but it is immensely rewarding. Not only will you learn new languages faster, but you will also become a better programmer even in languages you don\u2019t use!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Programming Languages, Part A<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> assumes you have some programming background or have taken one or two introductory programming courses. If you\u2019re a complete beginner, you should check out the other courses in this ranking before tackling this course.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part A of the course covers the basics of SML programming, recursion, data types, pattern-matching, tail recursion, first-class functions, closures, type inference, and modules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After installing and setting up <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gnu.org\/software\/emacs\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emacs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Standard_ML_of_New_Jersey\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SML\/NJ<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you\u2019ll get started with the basics of SML programming. You\u2019ll start simple, by learning about variables, numbers, conditionals, and functions.\u00a0 You\u2019ll then wade through unfamiliar territory when you look at how pairs and lists are used as two complementary ways to build compound data. Furthermore, you\u2019ll consider let expressions for local bindings, including nested functions, and the importance of bindings for efficiency. This will provide a more general perspective on the benefits of programming without mutation and the different aspects of a programming language.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next focus of the module will be on creating your own types: defining new types, building values of such types, and using those values. You\u2019ll discuss the key distinction in how to think about compound types (types built out of smaller types). You\u2019ll then use pattern matching to access the pieces of values built out of compound types, generalizing the idea to support nested patterns, as well as realize how SML uses pattern matching in every function binding and let expression, even when it does not seem like it. Finally, you\u2019ll study tail recursion, which is the primary concept one needs to reason about the efficiency of SML programs, and in general any functional program using recursion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving on, you\u2019ll study the importance of first-class functions and function closures\u2009\u2014\u2009the coolest (and most important!) part of functional programming. Starting with the basics of passing and returning functions from other functions, you\u2019ll learn about &#8216;map&#8217; and &#8216;filter&#8217; and understand the relationship between first-class functions and polymorphic types. You\u2019ll then dig into lexical scope, the key aspect of the semantics of a function that uses variables defined outside the function itself. A couple of examples using first-class functions are provided to demonstrate their usefulness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the final section of the course, you\u2019ll explore how SML does type inference, including inferring polymorphic types. You\u2019ll learn how to perform mutual recursion, and about SML&#8217;s module system and how it ties in with the fundamental ideas of encapsulation and abstraction. The course ends with a substantial discussion of what it means for two functions to be equivalent and how functional programming, particularly the lack of mutation, allows for more constructs to be equivalent. If you have read this far, pat yourself on the back\u2009\u2014\u2009you\u2019ve come a long way!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course is 5 weeks long with 30 hours worth of material, although you may take up to 40 hours to complete the course due to its rigor. You\u2019ll make use of both video lectures and the reading materials, both excellent resources to learn from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are three homework assignments that you\u2019ll have to complete in order to get a grade. These assessments aim to challenge your understanding of the material, so be prepared to put some effort into it. You\u2019ll also have an opportunity to share and learn from other learners&#8217; code. You do not need to pay for the certificate in order to be graded.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of Washington<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coursera<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dan Grossman<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intermediate<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30\u201340 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">135K<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.9 \/ 5.0 (1.6K)<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paid<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part A is the first of the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Programming Languages<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> series, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/programming-languages-part-b-6920\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">followed by Part B<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/programming-languages-part-c-7187\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and Part C<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

It teaches basic skills for computational problem solving applicable in many modern computing environments. After taking this course not only will you be proficient in Java, but you will also understand several fundamental concepts found in other programming languages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is suitable for first-year college students and even motivated high schoolers. It doesn\u2019t require prior programming experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course starts off by addressing the question \u201cWhy program?\u201d Then, it describes the anatomy of your first program and the process of developing a program in Java with some historical context.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll then move on to basic Java programming concepts like conditional statements and loops. Another feature you\u2019ll learn is arrays. Computing with a large sequence of values of the same type is extremely common, and you\u2019ll use arrays to shuffle a deck of cards and traverse a grid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Afterwards you\u2019ll learn how to interact with programs and present information to the outside world, known as input and output by programmers. You\u2019ll see how Java can be used to create fractal drawings that model natural phenomena and create an animation of a ball bouncing around in the display window.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll learn about functions and libraries, a fundamental mechanism that enables modular programming\u2009\u2014\u2009 breaking a program into pieces that can be individually developed. This forms the backbone of recursion, a subject you\u2019ll discuss through several classic examples, like the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tower_of_Hanoi\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tower of Hanoi<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A scientific approach to measure and understand performance will then be used to describe the running time of a program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll move on to object-oriented programming in Java. You\u2019ll create your own data types and use them in your programs as abstract representations of real-world concepts. This will culminate into coding a program that uses complex numbers to create visual representations of the famous Mandelbrot set.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course concludes with an overview of important issues surrounding programming languages. You\u2019ll be shown the important differences among these languages and address fundamental issues, such as garbage collection, type checking, object oriented programming, and functional programming with some brief historical context.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course is 10 weeks long, with 88 hours worth of material.

So, you\u2019ll have to dedicate a significant amount of effort to complete the course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To take this course, you\u2019ll need some background in high school mathematics (like the Pythagorean theorem). Another thing to note is that this course uses Python 2 but is nonetheless still a good introduction to programming.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course begins by introducing Python as a calculator. You\u2019ll learn how to express arithmetic expressions in Python and how to assign values to variables. Make sure to give your variables good names!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, functions will be introduced through both a programmatic and a visual perspective. This will give you an understanding on how functions work and how errors may arise from them. The instructor also gives tips on how to debug your code based on the results it\u2019s producing\u2009\u2014\u2009debugging is part of the process when programming . You\u2019ll learn logical and comparison operators, along with conditional statements, and use these concepts to build a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rock_paper_scissors#Additional_weapons\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock game<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving on, you\u2019ll be instructed on the basics of event-driven programming, which are essential to build games and applications. Then, you\u2019ll learn what local and global variables are, which will culminate in you building a simple responsive graphical user interface for a number guessing game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll learn how to process strings given by the user and draw text and shapes on a canvas. You\u2019ll use this concept to build a digital stopwatch that\u2019ll keep track of time to the tenths of a second.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the course, you\u2019ll recreate the classic game Pong in Python. Along the way, you\u2019ll learn how to work with lists, how to read keyboard input from the user, how to draw and simulate the movement of the ping pong ball in your application, and how to keep track of who won and who lost. This will serve as testament to your ability to create applications with lots of moving parts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course is split into 5 weeks, with each week involving around seven to ten hours of material, including a weekly project. The course comes with a companion website called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/py2.codeskulptor.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CodeSkulptor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where you\u2019ll run and submit your Python scripts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each week has two auto-graded quizzes and a weekly project that is peer-graded.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rice University<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coursera<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructors<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Greiner, Stephen Wong, Scott Rixner, Joe Warren<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginner<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">195K<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.8 \/ 5.0 (3.1K)<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paid<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course has 97.8K bookmarks and 3.3K reviews on Class Central.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have completed this course, you should move on to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/interactivepython2-3196\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">second part<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the first of seven courses that make up the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/computer-fundamentals-18928\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamentals of Computing Specialization<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

The language the course uses is C.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Programming is fundamentally about figuring out how to solve various classes of problems and write algorithms, a clear set of steps to solve any problem in its class. This course will introduce you to a powerful problem-solving process \u2014 the Seven Steps \u2014 which you can use to solve any programming problem. In this course, you will learn how to develop an algorithm, then move on to reading and understanding code, as well as comprehending how programming concepts relate to algorithms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You do not need any programming experience prior to taking this course.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first module introduces a powerful process for solving any programming problem \u2014 the Seven Steps. You will learn how to approach a programming problem methodically, so that you can formulate an algorithm that is both precise and correct. At this point, you should have a basic grasp on the idea of developing simple algorithms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the second module, you\u2019ll learn to read code. This means you will be able to execute a piece of code by hand, and clearly illustrate what each statement does and what the state of the program is. Understanding how to read code is the only way to be sure you aren\u2019t blindly writing code! By the end of this module, you will be able to read and understand code with functions, conditional statements, iteration, and other fundamental techniques.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the third module, you\u2019ll learn about types beyond integers, both their conceptual representations, and their hardware representations in binary. Everything is a number to a computer, but types determine the size and interpretation of numbers. You\u2019ll study the basic data types, \u2018non-number\u2019 types, and complex, custom types, as well as some important caveats, so that you\u2019ll avoid type-related programming mistakes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fourth and final module will entail developing and testing your own algorithm for sorting data. This will help reinforce the importance of being specific when you write an algorithm and provide an opportunity to perform a very common computational task: sorting.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course is 4 weeks long, with 18 hours worth of material. You\u2019ll primarily learn through video lectures along with some supplementary reading materials.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple quizzes that you\u2019ll complete throughout the course, and each module ends with a graded quiz to test your understanding. You\u2019ll need to have paid for the certificate to complete the graded quiz, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duke University<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coursera<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructors<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrew D.

This is because MATLAB is easy to learn, versatile and very useful for scientific computing. The design of the language makes it possible to write powerful programs that solve complex tasks in just a few lines, compared to other programming languages like C++ or Java.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an excellent skill if you\u2019re interested in scientific computing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming. Upon completion, you\u2019ll understand the general concepts of computer science and programming, and gain a solid foundation in the use of MATLAB.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students taking the course will get a MATLAB Online license free of charge for the duration of the course.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course begins with an introduction to the MATLAB environment and user interface, where you\u2019ll learn how to use MATLAB as a sophisticated calculator and how to create plots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, you\u2019ll learn how to work with basic unit of MATLAB\u2009\u2014\u2009the matrix. We solve problems by manipulating matrices, and operators are the primary means by which we manipulate them. You\u2019ll learn how to define matrices, extract parts of them and combine them to form new matrices, and become familiar with the operators and the orders of operations in MATLAB. Afterwards, you\u2019ll learn how to create and use functions to break down problems into smaller, more manageable and reusable parts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next section of the course deals with the many built-in functions in MATLAB. You\u2019ll learn about polymorphism, the MATLAB random number generator, how to get input and print to the Command Window, how to plot graphs in a Figure window, and how to use MATLAB\u2019s debugger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving on, you\u2019ll learn about basic MATLAB programming like selections and loops.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll learn how to use the if-statement, which is the most important method of selection, along with the for-loop and the while-loop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MATLAB has 15 fundamental data types, and you will study them in this section of the course. The course describes the ten types of numbers and how to convert one type into another. You&#8217;ll learn much more about strings, how to produce heterogeneous collections of data via structs and cells, and lastly, how to store points in time and time durations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the final part of the course, you\u2019ll be introduced to MATLAB\u2019s most important methods for reading and writing files\u2009\u2014\u2009like MAT-files, Excel files, text files, and binary files\u2009\u2014\u2009and how to navigate through folders with MATLAB commands. You now have a comprehensive understanding of MATLAB programming and programming in general!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course is 9 weeks long, with 35 hours worth of material. You\u2019ll learn primarily from video lectures, although there are a few supplemental resources.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best part about this course is the many programming assignments (20+) that the course provides for you to test your MATLAB coding skills, along with quizzes that\u2019ll test your conceptual understanding.

Then, you\u2019ll build a set of colored markers; teaching you the different ways of setting and pairing color values with each other to improve the aesthetic appearance of a webpage. Afterwards, you\u2019ll learn HTML forms by building a signup page. The first certification project results in you making <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/codepen.io\/freeCodeCamp\/full\/VPaoNP\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a survey form to collect data from your user<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second part of the course introduces you to the CSS box model by creating a Rothko-style rectangular art piece. You\u2019ll also need to ensure that your webpage looks good on any screen size by building a photo gallery with CSS flexbox. Then, you\u2019ll study typography by making a nutrition label, and accessibility (an often skimmed over topic!) by creating a quiz webpage. The second certification project requires you to create <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/codepen.io\/freeCodeCamp\/full\/zNqgVx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a tribute page for a subject of your choosing, fictional or real<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving on to the third part of the course, you\u2019ll make webpages respond to mouse hovers by making a balance sheet using pseudo selectors. You\u2019ll then dive deeper into the intermediate techniques of CSS by building a Picasso painting. Coding a piano will teach you more about responsive design. Your third certification project will be building <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/codepen.io\/freeCodeCamp\/full\/NdrKKL\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a technical documentation page to serve as instruction or reference for a topic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In part four of the course, you\u2019ll build a city skyline and see how CSS variables help you organize your styles and reuse them whenever you want. You\u2019ll want to have control over the grid rows and grid columns of your webpage by using CSS grid to build a magazine article. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/codepen.io\/freeCodeCamp\/full\/RKRbwL\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketing a product of your choice with a product landing page<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be the fourth certification project you\u2019ll have to complete.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last chapter of the course will teach you how to make your websites look lively and professional. You\u2019ll create a background and use positioning and resizing to animate a penguin with CSS transforms and use CSS animation to make specific sections of your web page more engaging by building a moving ferris wheel. The fifth and final certification project involves showing everything you\u2019ve learned in the course by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/codepen.io\/freeCodeCamp\/full\/zNBOYG\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">building your own personal portfolio page<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You\u2019ve built a lot of projects, congratulations!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course is split into 5 sections, with each section ending with a project you\u2019ll need to complete to earn a certificate. You\u2019ll learn primarily by doing the hundreds of short exercises in each section.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll also gain experience in building a web page from the ground up.

It is used to manipulate the HTML and CSS of a webpage, after it has loaded from the server. In a way, it brings life to a static HTML\/CSS website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/javascript-basics-36577\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JavaScript Basics<\/span><\/i><\/a><i> <\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014 well, introduces you to the basics of JavaScript.\u2009You\u2019ll learn the reason JavaScript was developed in the first place, and how this impacts the way JavaScript is currently written and in future releases. By the end of the course, you\u2019ll have the necessary skills needed to build a simple vacation destination list web application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll need some background in HTML and CSS in order to take this course. Other than that, no programming experience is required.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course starts with an introduction to JavaScript and what it can do. You\u2019ll learn the history of JavaScript and explore JavaScript syntax. After a brief assessment of your understanding of HTML and CSS, you\u2019ll write simple JavaScript statements in the web browser console and be able to create variables and arrays. You\u2019ll start by assigning values to these variables and arrays and reading values from them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have written your first line of JavaScript code, you\u2019ll then choose a code editor to write code and manage your files. With that out of the way, you\u2019ll be given an introduction to the three logical flow control structures: sequence, selection, and loop. You\u2019ll identify, write, and troubleshoot scripts using these basic control structures, and then put them all together to create basic JavaScript programs that can be tested. Finally, you\u2019ll combine sets of programming instructions into named functions and create custom functions that can be called to execute the instructions they contain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alright, let\u2019s get to the fun part: building an interactive website. This is where you\u2019ll start using built-in JavaScript methods for accessing and manipulating Document Object Model (DOM) elements\u2009\u2014\u2009representation of the page\u2019s structure, style, and content. We can capture user events with JavaScript and use those events to trigger changes to the DOM, but take note of scopes. You\u2019ll learn best practices for working with variables in JavaScript so that scope does not become a problem. And to top it all off, you\u2019ll put together a simple slideshow on a web page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course culminates in building a simple vacation destination list application\u2009\u2014\u2009your first\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">web application! You\u2019ll design a website and furnish it with an advanced distance converter.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JavaScript Basics<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is 4 weeks long, with 21 hours worth of material. You\u2019ll mainly learn through video lectures, with additional resources available for you to take a look at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course provides 30 challenges with the answers for you to test your JavaScript skills.

More importantly, it will introduce you to the fundamental principles of computing, helping you think like a software engineer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scratch is an easy-to-use drag-and-drop visual programming language. It is an educational tool for programming, so many of the programming concepts in other languages are represented easily here.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting with the first unit, you\u2019ll create your very first computer program! You\u2019ll familiarize yourself with the Scratch interface and its friendly features. Then you\u2019ll be introduced to basic programming concepts like algorithms and sequences, the incremental development of programs and simple software testing. The course will teach you about &#8216;if-then&#8217; statements and infinite loops.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Unit 2: Code Gone Loopy, you\u2019ll keep working with control structures like count-controlled loops, decision-controlled loops, and the if-then-else selection. You\u2019ll find out how to use events in your programs and how to incorporate visual and sound effects in Scratch. You\u2019ll learn about computational thinking concepts like abstraction (ignoring the unimportant details) and decomposition (breaking down a problem into smaller parts).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Unit 3: Remixing Games, you\u2019ll have a go at modifying and extending existing games to create new versions. To accomplish this, you\u2019ll learn about variables, complex conditions, nested loops, and a lot of designing! You\u2019ll also learn about software engineering practices for testing and documenting your programs. This will help you better maintain your programs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unit 4: Reusing Your Code introduces you to procedures and cloning in Scratch, and you\u2019ll apply the ideas of modularity, flexibility to make your code much neater.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the fifth and final unit, you\u2019ll think like a software engineer by following all the steps of software development to create (and publish!) your own fun computer game. You\u2019ll learn about software development approaches like the waterfall model, iterative and incremental, prototyping. You\u2019ll also learn a few important coding concepts, like coordinating parts of your code with each other with concurrency and message broadcasting, as well as understanding computational complexity. Congratulations, you are now ready to tackle other programming languages like Python!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course is 5 weeks long, with 12 hours worth of material. Each week&#8217;s material will be delivered as short videos supported by slides and code examples, as well as an optional in-video quiz.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help you reflect on the topics covered in each week, the course has included additional interview videos with computer experts and professionals in other fields.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from the quizzes, there will be two programming projects, which will be peer graded.
