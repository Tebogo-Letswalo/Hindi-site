I look up a lot of topics from MOOCs and OCWs I\u2019m taking, so my home screen has lots of bio, chem, philosophy, math, literature, and history suggestions. I also look up random things I encounter in the books I read: most recently, The Seven Samurai. Then there\u2019s general information I look up as needed: cooking help (what does one do with lentils?), houseplant advice (my polka-dot plant is not doing well), news topics. And I\u2019m not immune from clickbait: all the stuff I watch when I eat lunch at my computer (oh, come on, you do it too) and just want to watch something fun for fifteen minutes: random clips from shows I used to watch, humor, articles from Vox and Wired. Oddly, there\u2019s not much music at all, though right now Stan Rogers is showing up since a tweet put Northwest Passage and The Lockkeeper in my head.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, in my academic travels, I\u2019ve rarely watched the Crash Course videos. I find they\u2019re too general when I need more details on something from a MOOC, and Hank Green talks really, really fast. I think I\u2019m just too old for them (I\u2019m headed for my 70s, I\u2019m too old for a lot of things).<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s about to change, thanks to Class Central.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/history-of-science-karen.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-76257\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/history-of-science-karen.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"708\" height=\"359\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/history-of-science-karen.png 708w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/history-of-science-karen-300x152.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re launching a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/history-of-science-study-group\/\">new Study Group<\/a> based on @TheCrashCourse History of Science by @hankgreen.\u201d Hmmm, as one of my old friends from Days of Rogue MOOCing said. I\u2019ve just been emailing with my blogging buddy Jake Weber about the broad topic of religion, which always comes around to science (funny how that works), so my first thought was that this would be a rich vein for that discussion, which would actually be possible in a Class Central Study Group (the edX and Coursera forums are good for asking specific questions, but that\u2019s about it). Then, of course, there\u2019s my overall interest in science, set against the insanity I see daily on Twitter from those who either don\u2019t understand what science is, or just don\u2019t like its conclusions.<\/p>\n<p>Given my highly enjoyable experience a few months ago with Class Central\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mountains-101-study-group-review\/\">Study Group for the Mountains 101 MOOC<\/a> \u2013 a course I probably wouldn\u2019t have taken on my own \u2013 it struck me that this could be a really great six weeks. One of the biggest benefits of the group was trading resources and ideas, getting more out of a topic covered briefly. The Crash Course videos offer numerous jumping off points for deep dives, and the Study Group helps that happen. I just happen to have a wide range of resources, from MOOCs and OCWs to books and other videos, that I\u2019d love to share.<\/p>\n<p>I was just looking at an old blog post I wrote about a MOOC I took a long time ago, when Coursera\u2019s message boards were designed for real communication:<\/p>\n<div class=\"quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text\">\n<p>What made this course really sing was the student engagement in the forums. Early on, one student started a &#8230; thread, where we admitted our ignorance and asked stupid questions. The \u201cInsane Work Load\u201d thread turned into a home base for a lot of us, where we commiserated, then got organized to share notes, links, and, when things slowed down, just chat.<br \/>\nMaybe that\u2019s what makes any MOOC sing, at least for me. Now that I think about it, the courses I\u2019ve enjoyed the most were the ones where I felt the most comfortable on the discussion forums, where difficulties were acknowledged and shared and questions were answered without condescension, where I could enjoy and return the enthusiasm of others.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Now, this is going to be a little different, since the Study Group isn\u2019t working on a MOOC but on a series of videos. I\u2019ve sometimes referred to individual MOOCS as \u201cYouTube-with-a-quiz;\u201d I didn\u2019t mean that as a compliment. I wouldn\u2019t view these videos, one after the other, on my own. It\u2019s too much of a survey of a subject I want more than a survey for. And I prefer the structure of an actual course, with schedules (at least implied) and quizzes and, yes, I admit it, the academic imprimatur; I am something of a slave to credentials and authority.<\/p>\n<p>But maybe in the context of a Study Group, YouTube-without-a-quiz can serve as a focus for interested people to create their own learning experience with each others\u2019 help. And it might be ideal for someone who hasn\u2019t really explored science since high school \u2013 or, for that matter, is in high school right now \u2013 better understand what science is. And isn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>And it sounds like fun!<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m so excited about this possibility \u2013 which opens up huge realms of future explorations, since YouTube is crammed with courses formal and informal (yeah, it\u2019s not just Influencers and cute cats) \u2013 that I\u2019ve started watching the videos already. And I found transcripts! That helps enormously with the talking-too-fast problem, not to mention I like to keep documents with the text of courses I take so a year from now when I vaguely remember he said something about the PreSocratics that relates to something in a book I\u2019m reading, I can find it relatively easily. That document will also be a good place to store resources I find with the help of other students, as well as interesting tips an tidbits I find along the way.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/history-of-science-study-group\/\">History of Science Study Group<\/a> is scheduled to start on September 13, 2021; it\u2019ll run for six weeks. Each week will focus on eight videos, each of which is about 12 minutes long. So that\u2019s four hours of content, plus whatever time one wishes to devote to further explorations and sharing.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone\u2019s welcome, so if this sounds interesting to you, go ahead and sign up. It\u2019s free, it\u2019s low-pressure (as in no grades) \u2013 and it will, I hope, be fun.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a
