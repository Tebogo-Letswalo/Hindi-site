Being a block-based language where you can drag and drop code together like puzzle pieces instead of writing and memorizing text commands, it is significantly easier for anyone to learn and play with the language. The Scratch interface itself is also easy to navigate and contains a lot of tools like animation and sound which are often harder to implement in other languages.<\/p>\n<p>But what makes Scratch even greater is its amazing community. You can find and play other people&#8217;s creations on the <a href=\"https:\/\/scratch.mit.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">official Scratch website<\/a>, and it is easy to share your own creation with others. You can find a lot of support and inspiration just from taking a look at other people\u2019s projects.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79248 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2.png\" alt=\"Find your next course on Class Central\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Best Courses Guides Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous Best Courses Guides (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find them all here<\/a>).

You\u2019ll learn the fundamentals of programming and computational thinking, whose concepts will transfer over to every other programming language you\u2019ll learn throughout your career. Among the things you\u2019ll build are visual stories, animations, interactive art, and even games!<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll begin the course by first learning about sprites, character images that you can place on the screen and create whatever environment we want for the story. But sprites by default are static. You can make them react to events like mouse clicks by giving them instructions, otherwise known as functions. Now, you can make your sprite speak, move, and think in response to a user event!<\/p>\n<p>Variables allow the program to remember information, so you can give the program your name and have the sprite greet you. You can also have the program perform computations and even make decisions based on the value with conditionals and loops, which means you can express what you want your program to do even better!<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll learn how to think computationally starting with abstraction, which is simplifying concepts by hiding complexity. Abstractions allow you to keep track of what is going on without getting lost in the details. Finally, you\u2019ll learn how to approach building big projects from scratch (in Scratch).<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 3 weeks long, with each week taking around 2\u20136 hours of study. You\u2019ll learn by watching the lecture videos, reading through the lecture notes, and working your hands on the projects which come with each lecture. Once you have successfully submitted all your projects, you\u2019ll be awarded a certificate of completion if you score at least 70% on each project.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Harvard University<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>edX<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructors<\/b><\/td>\n<td>David J.

An Introduction to Programming<\/i><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This <b>free-to-audit<\/b> course is a collaboration between the University of Edinburgh and Universidad ORT Uruguay. It aims to introduce beginners with no programming experience to the fundamental principles of programming, computer science, and computational thinking. By the time you finish this course, you\u2019ll be able to think like a software engineer ready to embark on more advanced programming adventures.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The very first unit of the course plunges you right into the world of programming by tasking you to create your very first computer program! But first, the course introduces you to a few computer science concepts like algorithms, sequences, selections, and iterations, all of which you\u2019ll use later on.<\/p>\n<p>Next, control-structures will be introduced. Loops allow you to repeat blocks of code, while conditionals allow the program to choose between two blocks of code. You\u2019ll also learn about event-based programming for reacting to user events, before learning about software engineering principles for designing software.<\/p>\n<p>In the real-world, you\u2019ll most likely work on code others have already written rather than write your own from scratch. Hence, you\u2019ll learn how to modify code while also maintaining good practice of testing and documenting code. Additionally, you\u2019ll see why code reuse is useful and how modularity and flexibility makes code much neater.<\/p>\n<p>The last week of the course will help you create and publish your own game. You\u2019ll use\u00a0 software development principles to guide your process, as well as learn more advanced programming concepts coordination, concurrency and message broadcasting, and computational complexity.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course is 5 weeks long with 12 hours worth of material. You\u2019ll learn by watching the lecture videos accompanied by code examples and in-video pop-up questions. You\u2019ll also learn from watching the optional interviews with computer experts and professionals in other fields and learn from their experience. You\u2019ll gain theoretical knowledge from answering the quizzes and gain practical knowledge from completing two peer-graded programming projects.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institutions<\/b><\/td>\n<td>University of Edinburgh and Universidad ORT Uruguay<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Coursera<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructors<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Areti Manataki and In\u00e9s Friss de Kereki<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>12 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td>302K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td>4.7 \/ 5.0 (3K)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The course has 9.1K bookmarks and 12 reviews on Class Central.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/aprogramar-2939\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">It is also available in Spanish<\/a> as it is a collaboration with Universidad ORT Uruguay.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">This course can be taken by both adults and teens.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Although you need to pay to receive a certificate, you do not need to pay to receive a grade which is rare in other courses.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/codeyourself-2938\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-3\">3. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/introduction-to-programming-with-scratch-62899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Introduction to Programming with Scratch (Raspberry Pi Foundation)<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-83831\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/3.-Introduction-to-Programming-with-Scratch-Raspberry-Pi-Foundation.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/3.-Introduction-to-Programming-with-Scratch-Raspberry-Pi-Foundation.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/3.-Introduction-to-Programming-with-Scratch-Raspberry-Pi-Foundation-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/3.-Introduction-to-Programming-with-Scratch-Raspberry-Pi-Foundation-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>My third pick for the best course to learn Scratch is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/introduction-to-programming-with-scratch-62899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Introduction to Programming with Scratch<\/a>, a collaboration between the Raspberry Pi Foundation and the National Centre for Computing Education.<\/p>\n<p>This <b>free-to-audit <\/b>course will give you an exciting introduction to block-based programming and help you start your journey into the world of coding.
