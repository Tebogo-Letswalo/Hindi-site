This technique has been used throughout history to understand the technology (especially military) of others, from the <a href=\"https:\/\/historylist.wordpress.com\/2008\/05\/06\/reverse-engineering-for-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ancient Egyptians capturing and incorporating fearsome Assyrian chariots into their own army<\/a>, to more recent examples when <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tupolev_Tu-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Soviets reversed engineered American planes<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/nationalinterest.org\/blog\/reboot\/america-went-great-lengths-seize-soviet-technology-during-cold-war-167780\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vice versa<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In the information age, a new form of reverse engineering has emerged: Software Reverse Engineering (SRE). Instead of physical technology, digital technology can be taken apart and analyzed for information. This involves studying the program&#8217;s code and internal operations to understand its behavior and functions. Often, only the compiled machine code or bytecode is available, making it a challenge to translate low-level abstractions back into higher-level concepts.<\/p>\n<p>SRE is a valuable tool for malware analysts and security researchers. They can use it to create patches and fix bugs in existing software. Analysts can even turn the tool against hackers and find vulnerabilities in malware.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in working in the cybersecurity field, or if you&#8217;re curious about how some piece of software works under the hood (but don\u2019t violate any licensing agreements), learning SRE can be a useful skill to have.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png\" alt=\"Find your next course on Class Central\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Best Courses Guides Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous Best Courses Guides (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find them all here<\/a>).

By the end of the course, you\u2019ll have a good understanding of x86_64 architecture for Linux and be able to use different methodologies and approaches when reverse engineering an unknown program.<\/p>\n<p>To take this course, you\u2019ll need experience with C programming and assembly language.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>To reverse engineer a software, you\u2019ll need to know how software is engineered in the first place. You\u2019ll discuss how software is built and compiled, starting from high-level languages such as C and ending with machine code. Then, you\u2019ll have your first hands-on with Ghidra where you\u2019ll disassemble compiled bytecode to reconstruct x86 assembly-level instructions from it.<\/p>\n<p>But this will require in-depth knowledge of how C code is translated into assembly code. Therefore, this course includes examples of control flow, switch, loops, variables, functions, heaps, arrays, enums, pointers, and other common C constructs in assembly.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll survey the landscape of reverse engineering tools and compare the pros and cons between them. You\u2019ll also learn how to patch binaries to modify a compiled program\u2019s behavior and OS concepts such as system calls. Finally, you\u2019ll learn some of the more advanced features of Ghidra, such as loading external libraries, performing patch analysis and diffing, and generating checksums.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 4 sessions long, with each session taking one hour.

It is designed for beginners in information technology to help prepare them for the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) exam.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll analyze and understand common malware tactics using reverse engineering, and then learn how to identify, isolate, and defend against these threats using malware analysis and reverse engineering tools.<\/p>\n<p>No prior experience with programming or knowledge of assembly is required to take this course with <b>free limited access<\/b>. But, it is recommended that you have a general understanding of Networking, Operating System Internals, Programming, and Hacking.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>Antivirus software isn&#8217;t enough! You\u2019ll begin the course by discussing its limitations and why malware analysis (and having incident response teams) is so important to detect and prevent security breaches. Then, you\u2019ll set up a malware analysis lab, which will involve running a Windows XP Virtual Machine and funneling traffic to a Kali Linux VM.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have your malware environment ready, you\u2019ll study dynamic analysis\u2009to identify different types of malware in real-time, as well as assess its potential risk and impact. With dynamic analysis, you will be able to quickly identify indicators of compromise in a system.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also learn how to perform basic static analysis to analyze the code and functionality of malware without executing it by debugging and disassembling them. A hybrid approach using the two analysis methods will serve the greatest function for identifying malware.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you\u2019ll learn about packers, which are tools used to compress and encrypt malware to evade detection by antivirus software and make it more difficult to analyze, such as disguising themselves as legitimate software. Finally, more advanced malware are able to defend themselves against virtual machines, disassembly, and other tools you\u2019ve learned so far. Fortunately, you\u2019ll learn how to bypass these defenses by studying more advanced techniques.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>There are 7 modules altogether in the course, with the course being 9\u201310 hours long. You\u2019ll learn by watching the lectures and completing the hands-on lab exercises to give you practical experience on analyzing malware.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Cybrary<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Sean Pierce<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Advanced<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>9\u201310 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td>4.1 \/ 5.0<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The course has 1.1K bookmarks on Cybrary.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Sean Pierce is a lead red team engineer at Target.

You\u2019ll take a quiz on assembly code and recall its calling conventions.<\/p>\n<p>The reason you\u2019re looking at assembly in the first place is not to write it, but to analyze programs that have been compiled from high-level languages such as C and C++. You\u2019ll study common examples of C code and its corresponding assembly code, and learn how to use binary patching to fix security vulnerabilities in compiled programs.
