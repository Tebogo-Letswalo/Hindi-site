It is simple and powerful like its older brothers, C and C++, but unlike them it is a high-level language, allowing developers to program much more abstractly instead of being concerned with the lower-level details.<\/p>\n<p>The C# language is very similar to Java, but has more features and capabilities than Java, like operator overloading and pointers. It was created by Microsoft and in addition it also runs atop of Microsoft&#8217;s cross-platform and open-source developer platform, the .NET framework. Thus, C# is designed to be flexible, running on many different platforms and technologies. You can work on desktop development with WPF, mobile development with Xamarin, game development with Unity, web development with ASP.NET, and a lot more.<\/p>\n<p>It is for these reasons that C# is so popular, being the 5th most popular programming language according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiobe.com\/tiobe-index\/csharp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TIOBE Index<\/a>. Based on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/Salaries\/c-net-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,15.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glassdoor\u2019s user salary submissions<\/a>, the estimated total pay for a C#.net Developer is $109K+.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79248 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Best Courses Guides Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous Best Courses Guides (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find them all here<\/a>).

But before that, you\u2019ll set up Visual Studio and Unity on your machine. Then, you\u2019ll learn the C# and Unity framework basics to help you get started.<\/p>\n<p>In the next module, you\u2019ll study how computers store information as bits of ones and zeros and why computers need data types to differentiate between one set of bits and another. Then, you\u2019ll learn how to prompt the user to input a value, assign their value to a variable and operate on them to solve a specific problem. Lastly, you\u2019ll also learn how to use the debugger to find and squish bugs within your code.<\/p>\n<p>Object-oriented programming is fundamental in game development, as it models real-world relationships between objects that can interact with one another. You\u2019ll learn how to define and set up a class, create methods for objects within that class, and then instantiate an object from the class to create fun interactive applications.<\/p>\n<p>The course\u2019s final section details the creation of 2D games using Unity. You\u2019ll become familiar with the Unity editor, add and modify objects within the game, and create scripts that affect the object behavior.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course will take 5 weeks of study, with an expected 5\u201410 hours\/week for the first 4 weeks and 1\u20142 hours in the final week. You\u2019ll learn by watching the lecture videos, going through the supplemental course materials, and testing yourself on the practice quizzes and coding exercises.<\/p>\n<p>For those paying for the certificate, each module comes with a graded programming assignment with the exception of the last module, where you\u2019ll take a final exam in the form of a quiz to ensure that you understand everything you\u2019ve learned so far.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td>University of Colorado System<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Coursera<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Tim &#8220;Dr. T&#8221; Chamillard<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>21\u201452 hours total<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td>90K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td>4.6 \/ 5.0 (2K)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The course has 693 bookmarks and 1 review on Class Central.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Tim is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, where he teaches game development classes and runs the Bachelor of Innovation&#x2122; in Game Design and Development program.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">He also spent 5\u00bd years as an indie game developer in a company he started with his two sons.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/introduction-programming-unity-10136\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-2\">2. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/microsoft-learn-csharp-first-steps-62183\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Take your first steps with C# (Microsoft Learn)<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-81087\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/2.-Take-your-first-steps-with-C-Microsoft-Learn.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/2.-Take-your-first-steps-with-C-Microsoft-Learn.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/2.-Take-your-first-steps-with-C-Microsoft-Learn-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/2.-Take-your-first-steps-with-C-Microsoft-Learn-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>My second pick for the best C# course is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/microsoft-learn-csharp-first-steps-62183\"><i>Take your first steps with C#<\/i><\/a> by Microsoft Learn. C# was created by Microsoft after all, so Microsoft Learn is one of the best ways for beginners to start learning.<\/p>\n<p>In this course with <b>free certificate<\/b>, you\u2019ll learn the basic syntax and thought processes required to build simple applications using C# through interactive tutorials. By the end of the learning path, you\u2019ll have a great foundation to build upon in subsequent C# Learning Paths which are listed under Fun Facts of this ranking.<\/p>\n<p>No prerequisites are required to take this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course starts you off simple by writing tiny code examples to learn basic C# syntax like printing text to console. Then, you\u2019ll store and retrieve data in your applications by using literal (hard-coded) and variable values. You\u2019ll learn about five basic data types along with how to explicitly and implicitly determine the data type of a variable, which will be especially handy when you learn how mathematical operators allow you to perform basic calculations on numeric data.<\/p>\n<p>Learning how to process and format text is essential for the development of any program as well, so you\u2019ll also be introduced to the string data type which allows you to create string data containing text characters that can be concatenated and interpolated.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll use functionality in the .NET Class Library to call methods that return values, accept input parameters, and more. Additionally, you\u2019ll learn how to use docs.microsoft.com to research what a method does, its overloaded versions, its return value type, its input parameters and what each parameter represents, and more.<\/p>\n<p>By now, you\u2019ll probably want more control over the flow of your program. Boolean operators and if-else statements allow you to branch your code\u2019s execution path based on a condition.\u00a0 Then, you\u2019ll learn how to work with and iterate through sequences of related data in data structures known as arrays.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the course ends with a guide on writing easy-to-read code by teaching you the naming conventions, comments and whitespace.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course consists of 8 modules altogether and is 3\u20144 hours long.

Then, you\u2019ll look at some core programming concepts, like working with data using variables and expressions and taking care of different data types. Finally, you\u2019ll use these concepts to build a calculator.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you\u2019ll study arrays which are sequences of related values. You\u2019ll learn how to iterate through all the sequences with for loops and while loops. You\u2019ll also learn about if statements and case statements that will help you better structure the flow of your programs. Lastly, you\u2019ll use methods to reuse blocks of code and even return a value if needed. You\u2019ll apply these concepts to improve your calculator and a guessing game.<\/p>\n<p>The final part of the course takes a look at some object-oriented programming concepts like classes and inheritance. You\u2019ll study classes, which act as a template for creating instances of objects. You\u2019ll learn how to construct classes, giving them methods and attributes that can be inherited among subclasses, which will prove especially useful as C# is an object-oriented programming language.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 5 hours long.

But unlike other free Udemy courses, it has a lot of content and exercises for you to practice on. By the end of the course, you\u2019ll know how to work with data and use it, make decisions, use loops, arrays, methods, and classes.<\/p>\n<p>No prior programming experience is required to take this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins with an introduction to programming in C#, starting with data which is what programs are all about. Next, you\u2019ll learn about variables, the different data types you assign to a variable, and converting between one data type to another.<\/p>\n<p>Afterward, you\u2019ll learn how to make decisions within the program using boolean logic and if-else statements. Then, if you want to repeat blocks of code, you\u2019ll have the choice of using three kinds of loops: for loops, while loops, and do-while loops. For loops will especially be helpful when you want to iterate through a list of related data, otherwise known as an array.<\/p>\n<p>Methods are another way of repeating blocks of code. What distinguishes methods from loops is that methods can be called from anywhere whereas loops must be rewritten again. You\u2019ll learn how to create methods, pass arguments into them, and return a result.
