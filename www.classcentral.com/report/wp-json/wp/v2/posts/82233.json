You\u2019ll start from the beginning and work your way up to proficiency. The course is written in simple English and is accompanied by intuitive examples, which makes it suitable for anyone weak in English.<\/p>\n<p>No programming experience is required to take this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins with a history of the Go programming language and how to set it up. Then, you\u2019ll learn the structure of a Go program by writing and compiling your first \u201cHello World!\u201d script. You\u2019ll follow this up with the essentials\u2009\u2014\u2009variables, data types, control flow, and functions\u2009\u2014\u2009to write simple but fully functional code. In addition, you\u2019ll also get a grasp of code organization through modules, packages, and workspaces.<\/p>\n<p>The next section of the course delves into advanced programming concepts, specifically data structures like pointers, arrays, slices, and maps. These data structures are key for writing real-life applications. You\u2019ll also learn about methods, which are functions defined on data structures.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, you\u2019ll learn higher-level concepts that professional developers use in their programs. Interfaces allow you to define behavior for similar types of objects, whereas generics allow you to write type-agnostic code.

By the end of the <b>free<\/b> interactive course, you\u2019ll have the basics down along with other more advanced concepts like interfaces, generics, and concurrency.<\/p>\n<p>To take this course, you\u2019ll need some prior knowledge of programming.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins by elaborating the structure of every program. Every Go program is made up of packages. You\u2019ll learn how to import packages, define variables, and declare functions in Go. You\u2019ll also learn about the different flow control statements and in what scenario you would use them, specifically the <i>for<\/i>, <i>if<\/i>, <i>else<\/i>, <i>switch <\/i>and <i>defer <\/i>statements.<\/p>\n<p>What if you could define your own types? You\u2019ll learn how to do exactly that with structs and study composite data types like arrays, slices, and maps. First, you\u2019ll learn how to define methods on types. Then, figure out how to declare interfaces, how Go supports generic programming, and lastly how these components fit together in the larger picture of type-oriented programming.<\/p>\n<p>The final module of the course goes over concurrency, a key feature of the language. Concurrent programming is a breeze in Go thanks to goroutines and channels. You\u2019ll be instructed on their usage as well as the different concurrency patterns you may employ when coding.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 1\u20132 hours long.
