While tracking digital education often means logging many hours in front of a screen, some of our best insight comes from IRL conversations. Over the past couple of years, we have made an effort to meet more of the architects of online learning, by attending some of the conferences in our niche. (You may have seen us last year at SXSW EDU, Open edX, or LWMOOCs.)<\/p>\n<p>Since many of our readers are also involved in MOOC making and may be interested in finding new ways to connect with others in the field, we\u2019ve pulled together a list of all the conferences we know of that have something to do with MOOCs and online learning.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you are a researcher looking for a good venue to present your work; an administrator hoping to get out in front of the changes to higher education; a professor, videographer, or instructional designer looking for inspiration for your next MOOC; or an entrepreneur in the ed tech space, there is probably a conference on this list that will excite you.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve put a * next to the conferences we are planning to attend in 2019. If you\u2019re heading to one of these conferences this year, let us know.
