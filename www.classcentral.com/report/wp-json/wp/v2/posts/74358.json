The course includes four peer-assessed assignments that are scored by other students taking the course online.<\/p>\n<p>During the Study Group\u2019s bi-weekly meeting, peer assessments were brought up, and we shared some of the experiences we\u2019d had with them, in this course and others. They can be quite frustrating. Here are some of the problems we\u2019ve encountered.<\/p>\n<h2>Blank Submissions<\/h2>\n<p>While taking a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/listening-notetaking-6817\">course on academic note-taking<\/a>, my colleague <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@manoel\">@manoel<\/a> was asked to score several assignments that, surprisingly, were blank. Why would anyone submit a blank assignment?<\/p>\n<p>One reason is that some learners will score submissions without even looking at them. For your own score to be released, you must first score other learners\u2019 submissions. So some learners go through the motions just for the sake of getting their own score. As a result, even a blank copy might receive a passing grade.<\/p>\n<p>Another reason is that once a learner has submitted his assignment, he has access to other students\u2019 assignments. He can then copy one of these and resubmit it as his own. Providers like Coursera <a href=\"https:\/\/learner.coursera.help\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/209818823\">allow learners to revise and resubmit assignments<\/a>, which opens the door to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/coursera\/comments\/kne07g\/with_a_peer_review_assignment_has_anyone_gotten\/\">widespread<\/a> plagiarism.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_74362\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74362\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-01.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74362\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-01.png\" alt=\"Class Central comment screenshot\" width=\"800\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-01.png 800w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-01-300x128.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-01-768x327.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-74362\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Comment on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/the-second-year-of-the-mooc\/\">The Second Year of The MOOC: A Review of MOOC Stats and Trends in 2020<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Plagiarism<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes, submitting a blank assignment isn\u2019t even required to access other students&#8217; submissions. A simple Google search does the trick. For instance, Manoel found a website with solutions for all the peer-graded assignments of Coursera\u2019s Social Psychology course we\u2019d just taken. The website also has solutions for other courses, including courses from other platforms.<\/p>\n<p>A few keywords, often taken from the assignment prompt itself, is usually all that\u2019s needed to find solutions online. Some popular courses even have complete walkthroughs on YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>While providers usually ask students to uphold an Honor Code, sometimes by checking a box before submitting an assignment, it doesn\u2019t seem to do much to deter motivated cheaters.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-02.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-74363\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-02.png\" alt=\"Coursera Screenshot\" width=\"800\" height=\"254\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-02.png 800w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-02-300x95.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-02-768x244.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Many learners who spend considerable time and effort on their assignments feel aggrieved that cheaters appear to go unpunished.<\/p>\n<p>Some instructors mention the risk of plagiarism and ask reviewers to actively help catch cheaters by flagging suspect assignments. One way to find if an assignment is plagiarized is to Google a few sentences from an assignment and see if it returns some matches.<\/p>\n<h2>Organized Cheating<\/h2>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/the-second-year-of-the-mooc\/\">comment left on Class Central<\/a> by Coursera mentor Kristy Read, students created WhatsApp groups for some courses and gave each other good grades. Kristy and others feel that the issue <a href=\"https:\/\/iblnews.org\/coursera-users-complaint-about-cheating-and-plagiarism-on-peer-assignments\/\">mushroomed<\/a> with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/coursera-free-certificate-covid-19\/\">Coursera\u2019s free certificates offer<\/a> during the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-stats-pandemic\/\">COVID-19 pandemic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>On YouTube, Manoel also found videos that show how to cheat on popular online courses. These invite learners to join groups on various messaging platforms, such as WhatsApp and Telegram, to progress through courses together, share answers, and give each other passing grades.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, I came across a course discussion in which a mentor said a learner\u2019s assignment was plagiarised. The learner protested, claiming that it was their own work.<\/p>\n<p>Cheating on assignments is not new. The issue was already brought up in <a href=\"https:\/\/slate.com\/technology\/2012\/08\/coursera-plagiarism-why-would-students-cheat-in-a-free-online-class-that-doesn-t-over-academic-credit.html\">2012<\/a> during <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-hype-year-1\/\">The Year of the MOOC<\/a>, when Coursera and other large MOOC providers began to operate. While some measures have been taken, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/coursera.community\/community-help-questions-40\/how-do-we-make-coursera-certificate-more-creditable-when-there-is-serious-violation-of-intellectual-property-on-coursera-10439?postid=40747#post40747\">disabling the ability to copy\/paste<\/a> other students\u2019 assignments, it appears that over the last nine years, online course providers have made little progress in preventing at-scale cheating on their platforms.<\/p>\n<h2>Delays<\/h2>\n<p>Delays occur when no one is available to review your assignment. Some course forums are full of pleas to \u201cPlease assess my assignment\u201d. In fact, requesting reviews on the forum is one of <a href=\"https:\/\/learner.coursera.help\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/208279966-Solve-problems-with-peer-reviewed-assignments\">Coursera\u2019s own recommendations<\/a>, but not a very useful one considering many course forums are deserted.<\/p>\n<p>In 2020, this issue eased somewhat because of increased learner numbers, but as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/surging-interest-in-online-education\/\">surge of interest in online education<\/a> abates, the requests are reappearing.<\/p>\n<p>In a course I took in 2017, several of my assignments were assessed by the same learners, and I assessed theirs. When few learners are in a particular session of a course, it can sometimes take weeks for results to come back. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@ruima\">@ruima<\/a> waited more than a month for her final assessment in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/study-group-social-psychology\/\">Social Psychology<\/a> to be reviewed. My wait was shorter \u2014 10 days.<\/p>\n<p>A similar issue can occur when there are no assignments available to review. I have sometimes had to check the course each day for several days before I could review enough assignments to receive my own course grade.<\/p>\n<h2>Inconsistent Reviews<\/h2>\n<p>Most courses with peer reviews ask learners to review 3 to 5 submissions, then results at the extreme ends are ignored. This helps reduce bias, but it can be confusing for the learner.<\/p>\n<p>Some people will give full points just because the assignment was attempted. Alternatively, some people will give 0 points if they disagree with the assignment\u2019s opinions, even if the rubric asks peers to assess the writing, not the point of view. As a result, some learners who put time and effort into their assignment might get a low grade, while some who merely attempted the assignment might get a passing one.<\/p>\n<p>With participants worldwide, learners have varying command of the language (usually English), which can affect writing assignments as well as reading and commenting on others. Feedback may be minimal, which can be particularly frustrating if points have been deducted without explanation.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_74365\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74365\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-04.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74365\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-04.png\" alt=\"Coursera Screenshot\" width=\"800\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-04.png 800w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-04-300x190.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-04-768x486.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-74365\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Assessors who did not read the instructions.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Sometimes, such as when there\u2019s a lack of reviewers, your assignment score might end up being <a href=\"https:\/\/learner.coursera.help\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/208279946\">determined by a single person<\/a>. In those cases, whether you get a fair score will entirely depend on that person, which may lead to a lot of frustration.<\/p>\n<p>If you are unhappy with your results, some providers allow you to resubmit your assignment.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-03.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-74364\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-03.png\" alt=\"Coursera Screenshot\" width=\"800\" height=\"430\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-03.png 800w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-03-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/screenshot-03-768x413.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Advantages of peer assessments<\/h2>\n<p>With so many problems with peer assessments, you might wonder if there is anything good about them.
