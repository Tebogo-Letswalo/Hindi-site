Note that deep learning-only courses are excluded. More on that later.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It must be on-demand or offered every few months.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>It must be an interactive online course, so no books or read-only tutorials.<\/strong> Though these are viable ways to learn, this guide focuses on courses. Courses that are strictly videos (i.e. with no quizzes, assignments, etc.) are also excluded.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We believe we covered every notable course that fits the above criteria. Since there are seemingly hundreds of courses on <a href=\"https:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/click?id=SAyYsTvLiGQ&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;u1=cc-career-guide-machine-learning&amp;tmpid=14494&amp;RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.udemy.com%252F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Udemy<\/a>, we chose to consider the most-reviewed and highest-rated ones only. There\u2019s always a chance that we missed something, though. So please let us know in the comments section if we left a good course out.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"how-we-tested\">How We Tested<\/h2>\n<p>We compiled average ratings and number of reviews from Class Central and other review sites to calculate a weighted average rating for each course. We read text reviews and used this feedback to supplement the numerical ratings.<\/p>\n<p>We made subjective syllabus judgment calls based on three factors:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Explanation of the machine learning workflow.<\/strong> Does the course outline the steps required for executing a successful ML project? See the next section for what a typical workflow entails.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Coverage of machine learning techniques and algorithms.<\/strong> Are a variety of techniques (e.g. regression, classification, clustering, etc.) and algorithms (e.g. within classification: naive Bayes, decision trees, support vector machines, etc.) covered or just a select few? Preference is given to courses that cover more without skimping on detail.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Usage of common data science and machine learning tools.<\/strong> Is the course taught using popular programming languages like Python, R, and\/or Scala? How about popular libraries within those languages? These aren\u2019t necessary, but helpful so slight preference is given to these courses.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2 id=\"machine-learning-workflow\">What Is Machine Learning? What Is a Workflow?<\/h2>\n<p>A popular definition originates from <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arthur_Samuel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arthur Samuel<\/a> in 1959: machine learning is a subfield of computer science that gives \u201c<em>computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.<\/em>\u201d In practice, this means developing computer programs that can make predictions based on data. Just as humans can learn from experience, so can computers, where data = experience.<\/p>\n<p>A machine learning workflow is the process required for carrying out a machine learning project. Though individual projects can differ, most workflows share several common tasks: problem evaluation, data exploration, data preprocessing, model training\/testing\/deployment, etc. Below you\u2019ll find helpful visualization of these core steps:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/ml-workflow.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-65779\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/ml-workflow-1024x475.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/ml-workflow-1024x475.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/ml-workflow-300x139.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/ml-workflow-768x357.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/ml-workflow.jpg 1514w\" alt=\"Machine Learning Workflow\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>The machine learning workflow, via <a href=\"https:\/\/upxacademy.com\/introduction-machine-learning\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UpX Academy<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The ideal course introduces the entire process and provides interactive examples, assignments, and\/or quizzes where students can perform each task themselves.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"deep-learning\">Do These Courses Cover Deep Learning?<\/h2>\n<p>First off, let\u2019s define deep learning.

In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you\u2019ll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you\u2019ll learn about some of Silicon Valley\u2019s best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Syllabus<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>Week 1<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Introduction:<\/strong> Welcome to Machine Learning! In this module, we introduce the core idea of teaching a computer to learn concepts using data\u2014without being explicitly programmed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Linear Regression with One Variable:<\/strong> Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Linear Algebra Review:<\/strong> This optional module provides a refresher on linear algebra concepts. Basic understanding of linear algebra is necessary for the rest of the course, especially as we begin to cover models with multiple variables.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Week 2<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Linear Regression with Multiple Variables: <\/strong>What if your input has more than one value? In this module, we show how linear regression can be extended to accommodate multiple input features. We also discuss best practices for implementing linear regression.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Octave\/Matlab Tutorial: <\/strong>This course includes programming assignments designed to help you understand how to implement the learning algorithms in practice. To complete the programming assignments, you will need to use Octave or MATLAB. This module introduces Octave\/Matlab and shows you how to submit an assignment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Week 3<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Logistic Regression: <\/strong>Logistic regression is a method for classifying data into discrete outcomes. For example, we might use logistic regression to classify an email as spam or not spam. In this module, we introduce the notion of classification, the cost function for logistic regression, and the application of logistic regression to multi-class classification.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Regularization:<\/strong> Machine learning models need to generalize well to new examples that the model has not seen in practice. In this module, we introduce regularization, which helps prevent models from overfitting the training data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Week 4<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Neural Networks: Representation:<\/strong> Neural networks is a model inspired by how the brain works. It is widely used today in many applications: when your phone interprets and understand your voice commands, it is likely that a neural network is helping to understand your speech; when you cash a check, the machines that automatically read the digits also use neural networks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Week 5<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Neural Networks: Learning: <\/strong>In this module, we introduce the backpropagation algorithm that is used to help learn parameters for a neural network. At the end of this module, you will be implementing your own neural network for digit recognition.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Week 6<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advice for Applying Machine Learning:<\/strong> Applying machine learning in practice is not always straightforward. In this module, we share best practices for applying machine learning in practice, and discuss the best ways to evaluate performance of the learned models.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Machine Learning System Design:<\/strong> To optimize a machine learning algorithm, you\u2019ll need to first understand where the biggest improvements can be made. In this module, we discuss how to understand the performance of a machine learning system with multiple parts, and also how to deal with skewed data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Week 7<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Support Vector Machines:<\/strong> Support vector machines, or SVMs, is a machine learning algorithm for classification. We introduce the idea and intuitions behind SVMs and discuss how to use it in practice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Week 8<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:<\/strong> We use unsupervised learning to build models that help us understand our data better.

You\u2019ll learn the models and methods and apply them to real world situations ranging from identifying trending news topics, to building recommendation engines, ranking sports teams and plotting the path of movie zombies.<\/p>\n<p>In the first half of the course, we will cover supervised learning techniques for regression and classification. In this framework, we possess an output or response that we wish to predict based on a set of inputs. We will discuss several fundamental methods for performing this task and algorithms for their optimization. Our approach will be more practically motivated, meaning we will fully develop a mathematical understanding of the respective algorithms, but we will only briefly touch on abstract learning theory.<\/p>\n<p>In the second half of the course, we shift to unsupervised learning techniques. In these problems the end goal is less clear-cut than predicting an output based on a corresponding input. We will cover three fundamental problems of unsupervised learning: data clustering, matrix factorization, and sequential models for order-dependent data. Some applications of these models include object recommendation and topic modeling.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Syllabus<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>Week 1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lecture 1: We will discuss the various perspectives of the course and machine learning in general. We will then cover the maximum likelihood problem for learning parameters of a probability distribution.<\/p>\n<p>Lecture 2: We move to our first supervised learning problem of linear regression. We discuss the least squares approach to linear regression and understand the geometric intuitions of the problem.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lecture 3: We continue our discussion of least squares by thinking probabilistically about the problem, making connections to maximum likelihood. This will motivate the ridge regression approach to linear regression through a technique called regularization. We analyze and compare these two fundamental approaches to linear regression via the SVD.<\/p>\n<p>Lecture 4: We discuss the bias-variance trade-off using least squares and ridge regression as a motivating example. We then introduce Bayes rule and maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference as an alternative to maximum likelihood, making connections to ridge regression.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 3<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lecture 5: We discuss Bayesian linear regression as a natural development of ridge regression. This leads to a discussion of forming predictive distributions and \u201cactive learning\u201d as two features of the fully Bayesian approach.<\/p>\n<p>Lecture 6: We wrap up our focus on regression by considering cases where the dimensionality of the problem is much larger than the number of samples. We first discuss a minimum L2 approach, which is more useful for introducing two key mathematical tools in machine learning: analysis and optimization. We then discuss sparsity-promoting methods for linear regression.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 4<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lecture 7: We shift to the supervised learning problem of classification. We cover simple nearest neighbor approaches and discuss what an optimal classifier looks like. This motivates the generic Bayes classification approach, an approximation to the optimal classifier.<\/p>\n<p>Lecture 8: We move to general linear classifiers. We discuss in detail the geometric understanding of the problem, which is crucial to appreciating what a linear classifier tries to do. We discuss the first linear classifier called the Perceptron. While this method has been improved upon, the Perceptron will provide us with our first occasion to discuss iterative algorithms for model learning.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 5<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lecture 9: We discuss logistic regression, a discriminative linear classification model. We compare with the generative Bayes classification model via the log odds function. The likelihood distribution formed by the logistic regression model suggests matching it with a prior; through this example we discuss the general Laplace approximation technique for approximating a posterior distribution.<\/p>\n<p>Lecture 10: We make a \u201ctrick\u201d we have been using more concrete by discussing feature expansions and their use in kernel methods. After discussing kernels, we look at a specific instance of a powerful nonparametric model that makes use of them for regression (and classification): the Gaussian process.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 6<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lecture 11: We return to the geometric view of linear classification and remove all probabilistic interpretations of the problem. This inspires the maximum margin approach to binary classification. We discuss and analyze an optimization algorithm called the support vector machine (SVM) that achieves this max-margin goal. We show how kernels neatly fit into this model with no extra effort.<\/p>\n<p>Lecture 12: We shift to a radically different classification approach to the linear classifiers we have been discussing thus far. Tree classifiers attempt to find partitions of a space by which to classify data separately in each partition. We introduce a statistical technique called the bootstrap to \u201cbag\u201d these trees into a \u201crandom forest.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 7<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lecture 13: We discuss and analyze boosting, a method for taking any classifier and making it better. This is done by learning sequences of classifiers on various subsets of the data such that their weighted combination makes significantly better predictions than any individual classifier on its own. We prove the training error theorem of boosting, perhaps the most difficult part of the class, but well worth the effort!<\/p>\n<p>Lecture 14: This lecture marks the beginning of the unsupervised learning portion of the course. The first family of algorithms we consider are clustering algorithms. We present and derive the k-means algorithm, the most fundamental clustering algorithm.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 8<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lecture 15: We discuss the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for performing maximum likelihood via an indirect route. The EM algorithm is a remarkable technique that makes many difficult problems much easier. We discuss EM in the context of a missing data problem, but it will reappear in Lectures 16, 19 and 21.<\/p>\n<p>Lecture 16: We compare hard and soft clustering models and cover a modified k-means algorithm. We then focus our discussion on a probabilistic approach to clustering called the Gaussian mixture model, deriving an iterative EM algorithm to learn its parameters.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 9<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lecture 17: We move to another unsupervised learning problem of factorizing a matrix into the product of two smaller matrices. This is a widely-used technique for collaborative filtering, where we wish to recommend content to users. We motivate the model we discuss, called probabilistic matrix factorization, in the context of movie recommendation.<\/p>\n<p>Lecture 18: We discuss non-negative matrix factorization, which differs from Lecture 17 by restricting all values in the data and model to be greater than zero. This allows for \u201cparts-based learning\u201d from data, of which topic modeling is a prime example. We present the two standard NMF algorithms for this problem.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 10<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lecture 19: We cover the fundamental matrix factorization technique called principal components analysis (PCA), a very useful dimensionality reduction approach. Extensions covered include probabilistic PCA for image denoising and inpainting, and kernel PCA for nonlinear dimensionality reduction.<\/p>\n<p>Lecture 20: We move to the unsupervised problem of designing and learning sequential models. Our first topic is the Markov model. We discuss two important properties of Markov chains and apply them to the problems of ranking and semi-supervised classification.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 11<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lecture 21: We broaden the Markov model to the hidden Markov model (HMM). We clarify the important difference between the two and discuss an EM algorithm for learning HMMs. We give a high-level discussion of how HMMs can be used for speech recognition.<\/p>\n<p>Lecture 22: We discuss a final sequential model where all unknowns are continuous valued. We present the Kalman filter for object tracking and put all our Bayesian knowledge to use in deriving the filtering algorithm for real-time learning of this continuous-state linear Gaussian model.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Week 12<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lecture 23: In the last week we shift gears to two problems that are very different from what we\u2019ve previously discussed. In this lecture we cover association analysis, which is the problem of learning interesting highly probable combinations of the form A implies B. The clever and exact algorithm we cover makes this combinatorially \u201cimpossible\u201d problem very possible.Lecture 24: In this final lecture we discuss<\/p>\n<p>Lecture 24: In this final lecture we discuss model selection. We have made many modeling choices throughout this course without knowing exactly which is the best. This lecture discusses two basic techniques for choosing the final complexity of a model.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Reviews<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><em>Over all my years of [being a] student I\u2019ve come across professors who aren\u2019t brilliant, professors who are brilliant but they don\u2019t know how to explain the stuff clearly, and professors who are brilliant and know how explain the stuff clearly.
