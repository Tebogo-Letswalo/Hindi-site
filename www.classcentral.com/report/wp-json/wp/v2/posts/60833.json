However, lots of legitimate concerns come up when people discuss it. Here are the three most common misgivings that I hear about online education, and my thoughts on them.<\/p>\n<h2>MOOC Misgiving #1: How good can MOOCs be if they have such a high dropout rate?<\/h2>\n<p>Many point to MOOCs as being unsuccessful because it has an 80%+ non-completion rate. \u00a0I would suggest that this is perhaps not a very refined measure. A better measure might be the completion rate of classes taken towards a degree program.\u00a0 Arizona State University president Michael Crow\u2019s experience with ASU\u2019s online students points in this direction, with a retention rate of almost nine in 10 students.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>I would suggest completion rate is not a true measure of online education\u2019s value<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>How about the completion rate of courses taken for professional development or self-enrichment?\u00a0 I took Harvard\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/mooc\/442\/edx-cs50x-introduction-to-computer-science\" target=\"_blank\">CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science<\/a> on the edX platform a few years ago. \u00a0While in this case I fell into that 80%, to me, the experience was successful. \u00a0I had signed up to get my feet wet and experience online education outside of a formal degree program, and to learn some code to apply to the back end of some research guides I was writing. \u00a0Check. \u00a0This educational consumer lens is overlooked in the 80% statistic, and given the multiple layers of motivation for taking an online class, I would suggest completion rate is not a true measure of online education\u2019s value.<\/p>\n<p>As a broader, more telling example, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oclc.org\/home.en.html\" target=\"_blank\">Online Computer Library Center<\/a> (OCLC) found that in the last few years, about a quarter of U.S. adults with any amount of education beyond high-school have taken an online degree class. They reported that <em>\u201c87% of those who have taken an online degree class indicated that their top goals were met.&#8221;<\/em> This high satisfaction level held constant for all age levels. A further 75%+ felt online learning was worth the investment of their time and dollars, surely this represents powerful measurement and feedback.<\/p>\n<p>One final thought on that 80% non-completion rate. \u00a0What if the on-campus classes at MIT were free? \u00a0How many people would sign up and how many would then finish? \u00a0It\u2019s easy to sign up for a free class and then not feel concerned about wasting money by not completing the course. \u00a0What would the same equation look like if instead of MOOCs, free on-campus courses were made available? \u00a0I would guess there might be a similar ratio when comparing the completion charts of MOOCs and free on-campus courses.<\/p>\n<h2>MOOC Misgiving #2: How can you have quality education without face-to-face time between teachers and students?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Teachers-Facetime1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"532\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60849\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Teachers-Facetime1.jpg\" alt=\"UNIVERSITY_OF_THE_FRASER_VALLEY_PHOTOGRAPHY\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Teachers-Facetime1.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Teachers-Facetime1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Teachers-Facetime1-400x265.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Teachers-Facetime1-85x58.jpg 85w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><br \/>\n<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/ufv\/8042515604\" target=\"_blank\">Image via Flickr<\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-left cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Only 27% found the lack of physical face-to-face contact to be a challenge<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I hear regularly that the loss of physical face-to-face interaction inherently equals a degraded educational experience. In looking for a documented loss when moving into a dominantly digital environment, I found the opposite view to be more convincing. Most recently, a defining new study compared an on-campus physics class at MIT to the free edX version of the course. \u00a0Researchers found no difference in measured learning outcomes between the online and the on-campus group, and that in fact, the online cohort did slightly better on homework than the on-campus group. The results were equally as uplifting in a July 2014 report from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sr.ithaka.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ithaka S+R<\/a>, who, in a partnership with The University System of Maryland found that <em>\u201cStudents in the hybrid sections did as well or slightly better than students in the traditional sections in terms of pass rates and learning assessments,&#8221;<\/em> which held across disciplines and subgroups of students. \u00a0If online education, in its earliest stages, can produce measured results that meet or exceed those achieved in person, how valuable can the in-person, on-campus experience be? What do students think? That same OCLC whitepaper mentioned earlier found that of the online students surveyed, only 27% found the lack of physical face-to-face contact to be a challenge.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Online education puts the act of engaging in the hands of the student, easing away from the potential jeopardizition of learning that can come from relying on another to be inspiring, articulate, and meaningful.<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Gallup also has some thoughts on this. \u00a0In 2015, Shane J. Lopez, writing for Gallup says <em>\u201cHalf of the high school students we polled said they don&#8217;t have a single teacher who excites them about the future.\u201d<\/em> Apparently the same sentiment is true for a third of college students, when reflecting on their professors. \u00a0\u00a0Further eroding the perceived value of \u2018live\u2019 education, Lopez points to the Gallup study that found only 30% of K-12 public school teachers are engaged and 13% are \u201cactively disengaged.\u201d \u00a0I\u2019m not sure where this unnamed professor would fall on that spectrum; from a comment on an Inside Higher Ed article: <em>\u201cWe have a history professor who&#8217;s been using the exact same lecture notes since he began teaching 30 years ago.\u201d<\/em> Inspiring. Online education puts the act of engaging in the hands of the student, easing away from the potential jeopardizition of learning that can come from relying on another to be inspiring, articulate, and meaningful.<\/p>\n<h2>MOOC Misgiving #3: Isn&#8217;t online learning solitary and lonely?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Thoma-Loneliness.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"742\" height=\"594\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60847\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Thoma-Loneliness.jpg\" alt=\"Thoma Loneliness\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Thoma-Loneliness.jpg 742w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Thoma-Loneliness-300x240.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px\" \/><br \/>\n<em>Hans Thoma [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>While looking further to find quantified value of in-person groups and in-person group-work, I was more impressed with what <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quietrev.com\/\">Susan Cain<\/a> explains in her book <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking\/dp\/0307352153\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Quiet<\/i><\/a>, (in which she dismantles the myth of in-person group brainstorming being useful), <em>\u201c\u2026solitude can be a catalyst to innovation\u201d<\/em>. \u00a0She quotes Hans Eysenck, psychologist, who said that introverted (read: lone-wolf) behavior boosts concentration and <em>\u201c\u2026prevents the dissipation of energy on social and sexual matters unrelated to work\u201d<\/em> \u00a0(Eysenck, quoted in Cain). \u00a0How many of us are irritated or thrown off by the loud personality, the pot-stirrer, agitated by the malingerer, sneeze at the overly-perfumed, or simply find it intimidating to talk to an overly-beautiful colleague? \u00a0Imagine all of that gone, (either as a student or a teacher) and one\u2019s focus and energy simply being poured into the work at hand, working without those social and physical distractors.<\/p>\n<p>Although we\u2019ve been talking above about the power of working as an individual, as a boost to creativity, concentration, and mindfulness, it would appear that even brainstorming and collaboration is improved upon in the digital environment. In her 2012 <i>New York Times<\/i> article<i>,<\/i> Cain points to academic studies that found, when compared to working together in-person on group projects, the online environment creates both better productivity and better work output. In fact, for academics, <em>&#8220;teams whose members collaborate remotely, from separate universities, appear to be the most influential of all.\u201d<\/em> \u00a0So while solo, independent work (a natural outcome of online coursework) is thought to be both more efficient and creative then in-person group work, collaboration is not only possible in the online environment, it appears to be more powerful for it.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>The online environment creates both better productivity and better work output<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In<a href=\"http:\/\/www.danpink.com\/\"> Dan Pink\u2019s<\/a> influential work on motivation, he proposes that motivation is primarily comprised of autonomy, mastery and purpose. \u00a0One can imagine that the online environment heightens the autonomy leg of Pink\u2019s motivation trifecta.The mastery component is supported with skills gained by taking an online course, perhaps amplified further by the gamification of online education, gaming success being naturally measured in competency. As for purpose, the election to take an online course was a purposeful decision as is the resultant execution of the class as well as any personal motivators, such as gaining credits or exploring an area of interest. \u00a0Motivation elements can also be found in the earning of badges, completing mastery matrices and tracking one\u2019s personal course-completion chart. In sum, apparently we\u2019ll not only learn better, collaborate better, and be more mindful and creative, but we\u2019ll also be more motivated to learn using an online platform.<\/p>\n<p>If motivated, will high school students be more inclined to complete their degree program, and then go on to additional education? \u00a0Domestically, here in the U.S., almost half of high-school dropouts self-report deciding to drop out due to finding school boring. Is there opportunity to better address this boredom and lack of motivation to complete a degree, in the digital model? \u00a0If education becomes a student-driven, responsive model, with competency-based exercises and algorithmic suggestions on what classes to take next, will students remain in school? \u00a0How about students that are currently in school but are bored (fully 66% according to 2009 High School Survey of Student Engagement). \u00a0According to the same paper, <em>\u201cfive factors were likely to create a situation of learning instead of boredom: control, choice, challenge, complexity, and caring.\u201d<\/em> Online education hits the first four of these necessary ingredients beautifully, and maybe there\u2019s room in the digital classroom to cultivate caring (or perhaps a robotic tutor will have this attribute, or even, a student\u2019s in-house human caregiver). This same report opens with a quote from a survey-participant student \u201cWhen I am not engaged, it is because the work is not intellectually engaging.\u201d The student is right of course, and research into the concept of \u2018flow\u2019 backs this statement. What better way to be engaged, to reach moments of intellectual flow, then a responsive educational environment that constantly pushes new, appropriately challenging content to the education consumer?<\/p>\n<p>Online has the ability to provide informational and educational equality, and get us closer to an educational purity of purpose, universally, in a way never seen before, and we\u2019ve only just begun building the potential of what online education can be! Existing research in the fields of creativity, collaboration and motivation point to why online education could become a superior model based on innate human tendencies. No longer must access to quality instruction, research and information be exclusive to the geography of ivory towers. \u00a0What will we accomplish with that ivory tower at our collective fingertips? \u00a0I am savoring the anticipation of a unstoppably enlightened, <em>magnificently flourishing future<\/em> for our human species.<\/p>\n<h2>References<\/h2>\n<p>Bridgeland, John M., John J.
