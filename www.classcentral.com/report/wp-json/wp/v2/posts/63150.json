Four hundred and seventy-seven learners said yes, but two hundred and fifty-eight\u00a0learners stated that they did NOT INTEND TO COMPLETE the course. This showed that people come to MOOCs with different intentions. In fact, around 35% of both groups completed the course, which is a much higher level of completion that the vast majority of MOOCs. They bucked the trend.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>It is a category mistake to describe people who stop at some point in a MOOC as &#8220;dropouts.&#8221;\u00a0<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Now much is made of dropout rates in MOOCs, yet the debate is usually flawed. It is a category mistake to describe people who stop at some point in a MOOC as &#8220;dropouts.&#8221; This is the language of institutions. People drop out of institutions \u2014 &#8220;university dropouts&#8221; \u2014 not out of open, free, and online experiences. I\u2019m just amazed that 40 million have dropped <em>in<\/em>.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>False starters are common in the consumer learning market.<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So let\u2019s go back to that Dementia MOOC, where 26.29% of enrollees never actually did anything in the course. These are the window-shoppers and false starters. False starters are common in the consumer learning market. For example, the majority of those who buy language courses never complete much more than a small portion of the course. And in MOOCs many simply have a look, often just curious; others want a brief taster, just an introduction to the subject or some familiarity with the topic. Further into the course, many find the level inappropriate or, because they are NOT eighteen-year-old undergraduates, find that life (job, kids, and so on) makes them too busy to continue the course. For these reasons, many, myself included, have long argued that course completion is NOT the way to judge a MOOC (Clark D. 2013, Ho A. et al, 2014; Hayes, 2015).<\/p>\n<p>Course completion may make sense when you have paid up front for your university course, and have made a huge investment in terms of money, effort, moving to a new location, and so on. In open, free, and online courses there is no such commitment, risk, and investment. The team at Derby argue for a different approach to the measurement of the impact of MOOCs, based not on completion but on meaningful learning. This recognizes that the diverse audience want and get different things from a MOOC, and that this has to be recognized. MOOCs are not single, long-haul flights, but rather they are more like train journeys where some people want to get to the end of the line but most people get on and off along the way.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>The team at Derby argue for a different approach to the measurement of the impact of MOOCs, based not on completion but on meaningful learning. <span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Audience age<\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s two sets of data from the Derby Dementia MOOC and the six Coursera MOOCs delivered by the University of Edinburgh.

There is still a skew towards graduates, but this is because these are the early adopters and almost the only group who know that MOOCs exist. Only now do we see some serious marketing targeted at different audiences from MOOC providers, and this is starting to have an effect. Indeed, the majority of participants (55%) in the Dementia MOOC are not university graduates.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Dmooc3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" size-full wp-image-63153 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Dmooc3.png\" alt=\"Dmooc3\" width=\"320\" height=\"203\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Dmooc3.png 320w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Dmooc3-300x190.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Audience motivation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now here\u2019s an interesting thing:\u00a0a point often forgotten in MOOCs \u2014 learner motivation.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Dmooc4-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" size-full wp-image-63154 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Dmooc4-1.png\" alt=\"Dmooc4 (1)\" width=\"400\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Dmooc4-1.png 400w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Dmooc4-1-300x202.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Dmooc4-1-85x58.png 85w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This compares well with the Edinburgh data.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Dmooc5.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" size-full wp-image-63155 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Dmooc5.png\" alt=\"Dmooc5\" width=\"400\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Dmooc5.png 400w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Dmooc5-300x171.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is that people who do MOOCs really want to learn. They are not largely motivated by pieces of paper, or even by completion.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>As MOOC audiences are different from traditional HE students, and as their audiences change in terms of age, background, and motivation, the more likely it is that MOOCs will have to respond to these new audiences and not mimic university semester courses. The team at Derby have already suggested an alternative set of metrics for measuring the success of a MOOC. They\u2019re right.
